A childhood full of time in close proximity to nature made a lasting impression on Masson, and he drew inspiration from nature and landscape imagery throughout his career. At age 11 he enrolled in the Acad\u00e9mie royale des beaux-arts and the \u00c9cole des arts d\u00e9coratifs in Brussels, where he studied with the Symbolist painter Constant Montald. He first encountered modern art through the work of James Ensor before learning about the ideas of the Futurists and Cubists. At age 16, he was awarded the Grand Prix de l'Acad\u00e9mie for painting. Masson pursued further training in Paris at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des beaux-arts. While in Paris, he became interested in paintings by Nicolas Poussin, particularly their representations of mythological themes, subjects that he would later treat in his own work. With the outbreak of World WarI, Masson joined the French infantry in 1915 and fought in the battles of the Somme. He sustained a serious chest wound and was hospitalized for an extended period. Deeply traumatized by his wartime experiences, he also suffered a spiritual crisis and was briefly confined to a hospital for mental illness.\nDuring the early 1920s in Paris, Masson had a short Cubist-inspired phase before he became acquainted with the Surrealists, who introduced him to automatic writing. In 1924 Andr\u00e9 Breton invited him to join the Surrealist group. Beginning in 1925 the journal La r\u00e9volution surrealiste (The surrealist revolution) published Masson's automatic drawings. His experimentation with media continued during this period when he began to incorporate sand into his paintings by flinging it onto gessoed canvas, thus allowing an element of chance to enter into his work.\nBy 1929 Masson began to distance himself from the Surrealists, finding their theoretical pronouncements too polemical and dogmatic. He resumed contact with the group in 1936, only to make a final break from its members, including Breton, in 1943. Masson also collaborated with the alternative figurehead of Surrealism, Georges Bataille. Also in 1936 he drew the cover for Bataille's review Ac\u00e9phale (Headless) and continued to contribute drawings to all subsequent issues until 1939. During World WarII, Masson went into exile in the United States, initially in New York, where he continued to experiment with automatism and influenced younger painters such as Jackson Pollock. He later spent time in rural Connecticut, where the landscape again exerted influence over him, resulting in a number of expressive landscape paintings, some of which incorporated American Indian motifs and themes from Iroquois mythology.\nMasson returned to France in 1946. His postwar paintings reflect a unique synthesis of diverse influences. His interest in Zen Buddhism, for instance, dates back to the 1930s, when the Japanese author Kino Matsuo first introduced him to its tenets. He combined this and other long-standing influences, such as Impressionism, with a personal gestural calligraphy informed by his knowledge of postwar American Abstract Expressionism and French Tachisme (from the French word tache, meaning blot or stain). In 1954 Masson received the Grand Prix National des Arts. His work also became increasingly abstract in 1958, the same year the Venice Biennale dedicated an entire room to his work. Masson regularly produced designs for the stage, beginning with his designs for L\u00e9onide Massine's ballet Les pr\u00e9sages (Destinies) in 1933, through the mid-1960s.

He moved to Versailles at age 12 and studied Greek, Russian, and Spanish at the Lyc\u00e9e Hoche. His education continued at a variety of institutions in Rouen, Cambrai, and Douai, all in France, where he entered law school in 1941. A self-taught painter, he began his artistic career in 1942, making mostly landscapes and portraits. His professional life extended beyond painting to include such positions as interpreter for the U.S. Army in 1944 and later professor of French at the American University, Biarritz, France. \nSoon Mathieu began working with abstraction, citing Edward Crankshaw's Joseph Conrad: Some Aspects of the Art of the Novel (1936) as a source for his investigation. His early abstract work consists of amorphous shapes and experimentation with drip techniques. In 1947 Mathieu moved to Paris, where he worked as the head of public relations in the American transatlantic shipping company United States Lines. While in Paris, he quickly became attracted to the work of artists such as Camille Bryen and Wols (Alfred Otto Wolfgang Schulze), which he referred to as \"Abstraction lyrique.\" Within his first year there, he organized L'imaginaire (The imaginary) at Galerie du Luxembourg to promote Lyrical Abstraction. In addition to these activities, he engaged in philosophical and theoretical issues pertinent to developments in Art Informel.\nIn 1949 Mathieu participated in the group exhibition Huit oeuvres nouvelles (Eight new works), which also included works by Jean Dubuffet, Jean Fautrier, Maria Martins, and Wols. In 1950 Mathieu painted his first Tachiste works (from the French tache, meaning blot or stain) and had his first solo exhibition at the Galerie Ren\u00e9 Drouin, Paris. Mathieu's calligraphic gestural style is partially indebted to Hans Hartung, another artist associated with Tachisme. One of the first European vanguard artists to recognize the importance of American counterparts, namely Jackson Pollock, Mathieu also formed a close association with the group Gutai Bijutsu Kyo\u0304kai (Gutai Art Association, 1954\u201372) in Japan in the late 1950s. \nMathieu often squeezed paint directly from tubes onto the canvas and emphasized the necessity of rapid execution in order to harness an intuitive expression. Many of his titles refer to battles or other events in French history; in fact he identified his work as aligned with history painting, but he depicted monumental events in an abstract manner. On several highly publicized occasions, Mathieu introduced a performative dimension to his painting, executing large canvases before audiences while dressed in costume. In Tokyo in 1957, he made 21 paintings in three days. This merging of painting and performance anticipated the work of Yves Klein and other artists of the late 1950s and 1960s.

From 1886 through 1892 he studied law and economics at the University of Moscow, where he lectured after graduation. In 1896 he declined a teaching position in order to study art in Munich with Anton Azbe from 1897 to 1899 and at the Kunstakademie with Franz von Stuck in 1900. Kandinsky taught in 1901\u201303 at the art school of the Phalanx, a group he cofounded in Munich. One of his students, Gabriele M\u00fcnter, would be his companion until 1914. In 1902 Kandinsky exhibited for the first time with the Berlin Secession and produced his first woodcuts. In 1903 and 1904 he began his travels in Italy, the Netherlands, and North Africa and his visits to Russia. He showed at the Salon d\u2019Automne in Paris from 1904.\nIn 1909 Kandinsky was elected president of the newly founded Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung M\u00fcnchen (NKVM). The group\u2019s first show took place at Heinrich Thannhauser\u2019s Moderne Galerie in Munich in 1909. In 1911 Kandinsky and Franz Marc began to make plans for Der Blaue Reiter Almanac, although the publication would not appear until the following year. Kandinsky\u2019s On the Spiritual in Art was published in December 1911. He and Marc withdrew from the NKVM in that month, and shortly thereafter the Blaue Reiter group\u2019s first exhibition was held at the Moderne Galerie. In 1912 the second Blaue Reiter show was held at the Galerie Hans Goltz, Munich. Kandinsky\u2019s first solo show was held at Der Sturm gallery in Berlin in 1912. In 1913 one of his works was included in the Armory Show in New York and the Erste deutsche Herbstsalon at the Der Sturm gallery in Berlin.

He was part of the first generation of 20th-century Japanese artists to become acquainted with Western painting techniques, but he also explored both typography and Japanese calligraphy, important in his subsequent work. Suga\u00ef left art school prematurely to work in commercial advertising for Hankyu electric rail company from 1937 to 1945. During the 1940s, Suga\u00ef gradually became familiar with the work of European artists such as Max Ernst, Paul Klee, and Joan Mir\u00f3, and late in that decade he discovered the work of Americans Alexander Calder and Jackson Pollock through art magazines.\nHe dedicated himself to painting and moved to Paris in 1952, enrolling at the Acad\u00e9mie de la grand chaumi\u00e8re. He had his first solo show at Galerie Craven in 1954. Considered part of the \u00c9cole de Paris (School of Paris) and the Nouveau R\u00e9alisme (New Realism) movements, in 1962 he began to shift away from the abstraction in vogue on his arrival in Paris, moving from calligraphic, mainly monochromatic, organic motifs to more hard-edge geometric imagery. Suga\u00ef collaborated with critic Jean-Clarence Lambert to illustrate two books of poetry in 1957, and began writing short-form essays before publishing a book, La qu\u00eate sans fin (Endless quest), in\r\n1970. His work of the 1960s and 1970s featured large capitals and reduced typographic forms.

He studied fine art at Bandung Institute of Technology, graduating in 2001, and earned an MFA from Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, London, in 2005. Sunaryo is dedicated to painting, pushing its boundaries with innovative techniques. He distills a passion for comic books, science fiction, and Japanese manga into abstract compositions animated by dynamic gesture, entropic progression, and alternating centrifugal and centripetal forces that gather and disperse pigments over the surface of his paintings. Rejecting the paintbrush in favor of direct application with his hands, Sunaryo then moved on to industrial methods. In 2008, his impatience with the prolonged drying time of oil paint, further protracted by the layered density of his application, led him to experiment with pigmented resin, which has become his signature material. In its natural, plant-derived form, resin connects with age-old methods of preservation, notably used in ancient Egyptian mummification and varnishes. Sunaryo uses synthetic resins to cast sleek, futuristic objects, combining the traditional and contemporary significance of this material with the aesthetic heroism of Abstract Expressionism.\nIn the series Cyan Magenta Yellow Black (2010), Sunaryo used only the base palette of mechanical color reproduction to make his expressionist abstractions. In the series Frozen Stratum (2012), he further developed his compositions to include layers of digital photographic material. The multiple planes in his poured resin paintings generate a curious dimensional quality, as a sequence of components becomes a flat, pristine, and unified composition. The material\u2019s glossiness retains the trace of its fluid state. Sunaryo\u2019s paintings capture shifts between solid and liquid, static and animated, synthetic and natural, and are rooted in the embrace of chance. In some works, what is ultimately displayed is the \u201cunderside\u201d of the composition; when the resin dries, Sunaryo separates the painting from the ground and flips it over to reveal the finished work.

His father bred horses and supplied the czar\u2019s cavalry. Raised by a religious mother, Poliakoff attended church almost daily as a child, and the strong colors and contemplative, mimetic power of religious icons would fascinate him for his entire life. He took drawing lessons from age 14, part of a cultured upbringing that abruptly ended with the 1917 Russian Revolution. He fled the Moscow Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, eventually arriving in Bulgaria. There, he began to tour Europe during the early 1920s styled as a Russian cabaret entertainer. He continued to perform for the next three decades to supplement his nascent painting career.\nPoliakoff settled in Paris in 1923 and began to study painting in 1929, at the Acad\u00e9mie de la grand chaumi\u00e8re, Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi, and Acad\u00e9mie Frochot, where he took classes with Othon Friesz, a former Fauve, who may have influenced Poliakoff\u2019s interest in saturated color. Poliakoff\u2019s first group show occurred at the Galerie Drouant-David in 1931 and his first solo exhibition in 1937 at Galerie Zak, both in Paris. He briefly moved to London in 1935, registering at the Slade School of Art in 1936. Returning to Paris in 1937, Poliakoff attended Thursday open salons at Robert and Sonia Delaunay\u2019s studio in 1938 and 1939, and further befriended Vasily Kandinsky. Exposure to this milieu confirmed Poliakoff\u2019s interest in color, one founded on an admiration for Giotto, Simone Martini, Paul Gauguin, and Otto Freundlich.\nPoliakoff exhibited his first abstract painting in 1938 at his premiere Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, in which he participated regularly until 1945, when Galerie L\u2019Equisse, Paris, presented a solo exhibition of his work. Alongside Jean Dubuffet, Hans Hartung, and Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl (the latter\u2019s commitment to nonobjective art especially influencing the artist), Poliakoff is regarded as a member of the \u201cnew\u201d \u00c9cole de Paris (School of Paris) following World War II. Avoiding empirical, or overly geometric line and form, Poliakoff\u2019s canvases invest in the asymmetrical and expressive qualities associated with Lyrical Abstraction (Abstraction lyrique); Art Informel; Art autre (Art of another kind); and perhaps most often, Tachisme (from the French tache, for blot or stain). He produced so-called plastic poems, works that focused on superimposed colors corralled in linear shapes on the canvas, with hues mediated by texture and tempered by his experiments with monochromatic painting between 1947 and 1950. Poliakoff received the Kandinsky Prize in 1947, and exhibited in the late 1940s at the Galerie Denise Ren\u00e9, Paris, alongside contemporaries such as C\u00e9sar Domela, Auguste Herbin, and G\u00e9rard Schneider. He contrasted rich, almost jewel-like colors in his mature canvases before returning to more subdued tones in the 1960s. After suffering a heart attack in 1965, he began working on smaller format canvas and lithograph.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Moscow", "artistBirthDate": "1900", "artistDeathDate": "1969"}}, "441": {"paintingDate": "1867", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/78.2514.67_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Sent to boarding school in France, he returned after six years to work in his parents\u2019 store. Pissarro abandoned this comfortable bourgeois existence at the age of twenty-two, when he left for Caracas with Danish painter Fritz Melbye, who became his first serious artistic influence.\nAfter returning briefly to Saint Thomas, Pissarro left in 1855 for Paris, where he studied at various academic institutions (including the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and Acad\u00e9mie Suisse) and under a succession of masters, such as Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Gustave Courbet, and Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny. Corot is often considered Pissarro\u2019s most important early influence; Pissarro listed himself as Corot\u2019s pupil in the catalogues to the 1864 and 1865 Paris Salons. While Pissarro was accepted to show at the official Salon throughout the 1860s, in 1863 he participated with Edouard Manet, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, and others in the historic Salon des Refus\u00e9s. At the close of the decade, he moved to Louveciennes (near the Seine, twenty miles from Paris). Working in close proximity with Claude Monet, Pierre Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley, he began to revise his method of landscape painting, privileging the role of color in his expression of natural phenomena and employing smaller patches of paint. This artistic circle was dispersed by the Franco-Prussian War, which Pissarro fled by moving to London in 1870\u201371. There he met Paul Durand-Ruel, the Parisian dealer who would become an ardent supporter of Pissarro and his fellow Impressionists. Pissarro participated in his last official Salon in 1870.\nThe years after Pissarro\u2019s return to France were seminal ones. He settled in Pontoise, where he received young artists seeking advice, including Paul C\u00e9zanne and Paul Gauguin. He took part in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. Pissarro\u2014along with Edgar Degas, one of the Salon\u2019s most passionate critics\u2014was the only artist to show at all eight of the Impressionist exhibitions, the last of which took place in 1886.\nPissarro experienced somewhat of an artistic crisis in 1885. As he had done consistently throughout his career, he opened himself up to fresh influences by meeting with the younger generation, this time with Paul Signac and Georges Seurat, who were experimenting with a divisionist technique rooted in the scientific study of optics.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "St. Thomas", "artistBirthDate": "1830", "artistDeathDate": "1903"}}, "440": {"paintingDate": "1965", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/91.3916_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

The son of an academic painter, Jos\u00e9 Ruiz Blasco, he began to draw at an early age. In 1895 the family moved to Barcelona, and Picasso studied there at La Lonja, the academy of fine arts. His visit to Horta de Ebro from 1898 to 1899 and his association with the group at the caf\u00e9 Els Quatre Gats in about 1899 were crucial to his early artistic development. Picasso\u2019s first exhibition took place in Barcelona in 1900, and that fall he went to Paris for the first of several stays during the early years of the century. Picasso settled in Paris in April 1904, and his circle of friends soon included Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Gertrude and Leo Stein, as well as two dealers, Ambroise Vollard and Berthe Weill.\nHis style developed from the Blue Period (1901\u201304) to the Rose Period (1905) to the pivotal work Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon (1907), and the subsequent evolution of Cubism from an Analytic phase (ca. 1908\u201311) to its Synthetic phase (beginning in 1912\u201313). Picasso\u2019s collaboration on ballet and theatrical productions began in 1916. Soon thereafter, his work was characterized by neoclassicism and a renewed interest in drawing and figural representation. In the 1920s the artist and his wife, Olga (whom he had married in 1918), continued to live in Paris, to travel frequently, and to spend their summers at the beach. From 1925 to the 1930s Picasso was involved to a certain degree with the Surrealists, and from the fall of 1931 he was especially interested in making sculpture. In 1932, with large exhibitions at the Galeries Georges Petit, Paris, and the Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich, and the publication of the first volume of Christian Zervos\u2019s catalogue raisonn\u00e9, Picasso\u2019s fame increased markedly.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "M\u00e1laga", "artistBirthDate": "1881", "artistDeathDate": "1973"}}, "447": {"paintingDate": "1946", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/76.2553.149_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He earned a degree in psychology from the Rangoon Arts and Science University in 1968. In 1989, he founded the Inya Gallery of Art in Yangon. Despite the governmental censorship and limitation of cultural life in Myanmar, Aung Myint has continued to make art that exists outside the boundaries of official edict. A self-taught artist, he began working primarily in painting and installation, extending his practice to include performance in 1995. Aung Myint experiments with medium and form to explore themes of cultural identity and personal memory. His practice often questions the place of small collectives within larger communities, both within and beyond the borders of his homeland.    \nAung Myint\u2019s series of monochromatic drawings, Mother and Child (2002\u20132008), turns single, unbroken lines of black acrylic into gestural forms loosely reminiscent of the piet\u00e0. The lines\u2019 fluid continuity evokes the intimate physical connection of the two figures. Aung Myint\u2019s work is informed by the artist\u2019s feelings of loss and abandonment at the death of his mother when he was an infant, and can be interpreted as a self-portrait based on the universal theme of the maternal relationship. Representative of his openness to a variety of media is Self-Portrait, a photographic series and installation conceptualized in the 1990s in which the artist is depicted removing his usual outfit of button-down shirt, longyi (Burmese sarong), and sandals. His prosaic act of draping each article across the back of a chair conveys an atmosphere of intimate familiarity and a sense of global connectedness. This exploration is continued in World Series: Five Continents Tattered (2010). Having painted the five continents on a canvas, the artist repeatedly punctured its surface before stitching up the holes, creating a random pattern of scars. Represented almost as a single landmass, the continents are covered in red x\u2019s, at times so densely that the breadth and intensity of the bloodshed for which they stand becomes impossible to ignore. The stitches symbolize the potential for healing between countries of opposing politics, religions, and beliefs, and act as a reminder of the potential for change. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Yangon", "artistBirthDate": "1946", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "31": {"paintingDate": "1932", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/55.1437_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Her mother encouraged her to become a medical illustrator from a young age, enrolling her in art classes at age 11. Baer went on to study biology at the University of Washington, Seattle (1946\u201349), where she also took introductory painting and drawing courses. In 1949, Baer spent six months on a kibbutz in Israel before moving to New York, where she studied perceptual psychology and philosophy at the New School for Social Research (1950\u201353).\nBaer moved to Los Angeles in 1953, where she made Abstract Expressionist paintings (most of which she later destroyed). She returned to New York in 1960 and began to explore Hard-edge painting. Soon she became known, particularly among artists, for her radically spare canvases; Dan Flavin and Dan Graham both included Baer\u2019s work in group exhibitions in 1964. For these early works, Baer used permutations of a strict vocabulary of visual elements, resulting in predominantly white paintings with bands of color that grip or wrap their edges. These call attention to the sculptural qualities of her canvases, which are heightened by their being hung low to the ground or arranged as diptychs. The smooth application of paint and lack of figurative imagery illuminate the relationship between the plane of the painting and that of the wall: Baer\u2019s paintings do not assert their own spatial logic but rather are contiguous with their environment.\nDespite her adherence to Minimalist principles, Baer differed with her peers Donald Judd and Robert Morris on the question of medium. In 1967, she wrote a letter to Artforum arguing against the so-called \u201cdeath of painting\u201d and attacking Judd and Morris for suggesting that only sculpture could be truly autonomous from the illusionism of art. In 1970, Baer began to introduce diagonal and curved flourishes into her paintings. These works were titled using Latin botanical terms that offered puns on painting, such as Tenebrosa (darkening) or Arcuata (curved).\nAfter a 1975 retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, Baer moved to Ireland and made a dramatic break from her prior work, pursuing a painting style she described as \u201cradical figuration.\u201d Her initial imagery borrowed from Paleolithic art and archetypal symbols of the female sex. In 1983 Baer wrote, \u201cI am no longer an abstract artist,\u201d a polemical article published in Art in America. She argued passionately that Minimalist critique had run its course, and that figuration must be embraced so that it could be pursued to radical ends. Later she explained, \u201cI wanted more subject matter and more meaning. There was an awful lot going on in the world, and I didn\u2019t just want to sit there and draw straight lines.\u201d\u00b9 Baer\u2019s more recent work builds on her initial aims for radical figuration. Her compositions in painting and drawing include fragmentary images, some sourced from art history, which float against ethereal wisps and washes of color. She sustains the individual elements along a single spatial plane, creating what she has called a \u201cmetaphoric world\u201d for her colliding figures.\nBaer has been the subject of numerous monographic exhibitions at venues including the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford (1977); Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, Netherlands (1986); Moore College of Art, Philadelphia (1993); and Rijksmuseum Kroeller-Mueller, Otterlo, Netherlands (1993). In 1999 the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, presented a retrospective of her work, and in 2002, the Dia Center for the Arts, New York, organized a survey of her Minimalist paintings.

His siblings shared his interest in art; he devoted himself to painting while his older brothers Dino and Mirko became sculptors. Afro studied in Florence and Venice, and in 1932 his first solo exhibition was held at Galleria del Milione, Milan. In 1933 Afro started working in a figurative style rich in symbolic accents and pale and ethereal tones, akin to that of the Scuola Romana (Roman School), with which he was temporarily affiliated. Afro moved to Rome in 1938, but served in the Italian army (and participated in the anti-Fascist Resistance) during World War II. He also taught mosaic design at the Accademia di belle arti, Venice, and his work took a new slant, as figuration gradually gave way to a growing interest in Cubism. \nReturning to Rome in 1945, Afro encountered tensions between proponents of abstraction and those who favored realism, but he was only marginally involved in these controversies. By the end of the decade he had developed a strand of abstraction based on intersecting geometric planes and expressive juxtapositions of color and light. Increasingly weary of the polemics among painters in Italy, Afro turned his attention to the American scene. In 1950 he traveled to New York for the opening of a group show of Italian artists at the Catherine Viviano Gallery, a venue that hosted his first U.S. solo exhibition later that year and regular exhibitions of his work through 1968.\nFrom 1952 Afro's painting took a new direction, adding fluid signs, rounded contours, and a brighter palette and replacing the angular forms and quasi-monochromatic pictorial language of earlier years. That same year he joined the Gruppo degli Otto Pittori Italiani (Group of eight Italian painters, 1952\u201354), whose \"abstract-concrete\" leanings represented an alternative to the Italian abstraction-realism polarization. The group exhibited together at the 1952 Venice Biennale, but by 1954 Afro had distanced himself from the Otto\u2014a move that coincided with the introduction of an increasingly dynamic gesture in his works. More dramatic and spontaneous, Afro's late 1950s works testify to his growing interest in Abstract Expressionism, amplified by his friendship with Willem de Kooning, who stayed in Afro's studio in Rome in 1959, and Afro's frequent visits to the United States. James Johnson Sweeney, art critic and former director of the Guggenheim Museum, authored an early monograph on Afro in 1961. Afro's paintings of the 1960s were increasingly gestural, a tendency that he reversed at the end of the decade when his works became more synthetic and geometric. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Udine", "artistBirthDate": "1912", "artistDeathDate": "1976"}}, "99": {"paintingDate": "1909\u201310", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/41.462_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Between 1905 and 1907 Delaunay became friendly with Henri Rousseau and Jean Metzinger and studied the color theories of Michel-Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul. During these years, he painted in a Neo-Impressionist manner; Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s work also influenced Delaunay around this time. From 1907 to 1908 he served in the military in Laon, and upon returning to Paris he had contact with the Cubists. The period of 1909\u201310 saw the emergence of Delaunay\u2019s personal style; he painted his first Eiffel Tower in 1909.

In 1924 he visited museums in Belgium and studied further in Brussels and Antwerp. De Kooning came to the United States in 1926 and settled briefly in Hoboken, New Jersey.

In the late 1930s his abstract and figurative work was primarily influenced by the Cubism and Surrealism of Pablo Picasso and also by Gorky, with whom he shared a studio.\nIn 1938 De Kooning started his first Women series, which would become a major recurrent theme. During the 1940s he participated in group shows with other artists who would form the New York school and become known as Abstract Expressionists. De Kooning's first solo show, which took place at the Egan Gallery, New York, in 1948, established his reputation as a major artist; it included a number of the black-and-white abstractions he had initiated in 1946.

After serving in the U.S. Army from 1955 through 1958, he earned a BFA at Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, in 1963. Cottingham began his professional artistic career as an art director for the advertising firm Young and Rubicam in the early 1960s. Although he is typically associated with Photorealism, Cottingham never considered himself a Photorealist, but rather a realist painter working in a long tradition of American vernacular scenes. In this respect, his work often draws parallels to a number of American painters such as Stuart Davis, Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, and Charles Sheeler.\nCottingham\u2019s interest in the intersections of art and commerce derive from his career as an adman and the influence of Pop art. Many of his paintings convey an interest in typography and lettering, as well as an awareness of the psychological impact of certain isolated words and letters. In his facades, techniques from advertising, namely cropping and enlarging, often produce words of enigmatic or comical resonance such as \u201cArt,\u201d \u201cHa,\u201d or \u201cOh.\u201d Cottingham\u2019s enlarged sense of scale is reminiscent of James Rosenquist\u2019s work, while his interest in text suggests the influence of Robert Indiana and Jasper Johns. In general, Cottingham viewed his work as continuing the legacy of Pop artists such as Andy Warhol, who also had a background in advertising.\nIn 1964, Cottingham relocated to Los Angeles for work. There, inspired by the drastically different environment of the West Coast metropolis, he began to commit seriously to painting. Fascinated by Hollywood\u2019s exaggerated glitz and the downtrodden atmosphere of the downtown, Cottingham saw in Los Angeles the relics of a bygone commercial heyday and desired to capture its kitschy and uncanny atmosphere, bathed in the near perpetual sunlight of Southern California.\nIn 1968, Cottingham ended his advertising career in order to devote all his time to painting. In the late 1960s, he started using photography in his practice, first as an initial reference point for his process. After selecting a photograph, he translates it into black-and-white drawings by projecting the image onto gridded paper, as a means of perfecting the tonal range between light and shadow. He often creates subsequent studies on paper using color. He finalizes the process by projecting either the original slide or any of the drawings onto a canvas and organizing the composition according to a grid. Another reason for Cottingham\u2019s rejection of the Photorealist label is that he does not view his works as mere painterly translations of photographs or reproductions of reality. He has been known to change the words in his facades to alter the meaning of the subject. His primary interest lies in the subject matter\u2014the urban American vernacular\u2014rather than the deployment of a photo-based technique. After spending a period of time in London from 1972 to 1976, Cottingham found the city\u2019s signs and history too foreign and removed from his own interests, and returned to the United States to settle in rural Connecticut. During the late 1970s and 1980s, his urban cityscapes became more expansive, with more complex and broader views of storefronts, vistas, and entire neighborhoods. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cottingham expanded his iconography of American vernacular culture to include trains and railroad imagery. More recently, he has focused on images of vintage typewriters, a subject that first interested him in the late 1990s.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Brooklyn", "artistBirthDate": "1935", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "90": {"paintingDate": "1971", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/71.1948_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In 1963 she received a BFA from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she studied psychology, and in 1968 an MFA from the Chouinard Art Institute, Los Angeles (now California Institute of Arts, Valencia), where she studied painting, philosophy, and Tibetan Buddhism. In the mid-1960s, she produced white monochromes on shaped canvases and Plexiglas constructions illuminated by fluorescent light bulbs. One such work, Untitled (Space + Electric Light) (1968), is a glowing cube made from Plexiglas, neon, and tesla, a high-voltage, low-current energy system. In 1968, she began incorporating glass microspheres, tiny prismatic beads often embedded into highway pavement for their reflective properties, into her paintings and blended them with different shades of acrylic, a technique that still forms the basis of her work.\nCorse is often considered part of the Light and Space movement, an otherwise male-dominated movement that developed in Southern California in the 1960s and includes Larry Bell, Robert Irwin, James Turrell, and Doug Wheeler. However, Corse maintains that, at least in the 1960s, she was neither part of the group nor influenced by their work. Nonetheless, this set of loosely affiliated artists worked with the medium of light, using reflective or transparent surfaces like resin or Plexiglas, or specific materials or technologies developed for the car or aviation industries. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Corse briefly switched her production to large paintings with heavy slabs in dark clay, but soon returned to painting and incorporating microspheres into the medium. Her technique transforms opaque and blank Minimalist canvases into surfaces on which hard-edged stripes or blocks and gestural brushstrokes seem to appear and disappear. In Untitled (White Multiple Inner Bands, Beveled) (2011), several vertical gray bands near the painting\u2019s center come into and out of view as the viewer shifts perspective. The visual instability of Corse\u2019s canvases underscores the artist\u2019s conviction that perception is the most important aesthetic act and that these seeming accidents of perception are more interesting than accidental gestures by the artist on the canvas. This position subtly undermines the tenets of Minimalism. While that style tends to refute gestural works, Corse\u2019s canvases incorporate both gesture and chance into an otherwise Minimalist framework. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Berkeley", "artistBirthDate": "1945", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "93": {"paintingDate": "1958", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/83.3133_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Shortly after enrolling at Hunter College, New York, she withdrew in 1937 and began studying art at the Leonardo da Vinci Art School, New York, with Conrad Marca-Relli, who became a close friend. She also took drawing classes from the man who would eventually become her husband, Willem de Kooning, in 1938. Her early works are still lifes and portraits distinctly influenced by Cubism, but in the mid- to late 1940s she began making abstract paintings as well as writing art criticism. She worked as an editorial associate at Art News under Thomas Hess, writing essays on Arshile Gorky, Hans Hofmann, and Franz Kline, and making Abstract Expressionism accessible to a broader audience. In 1948, De Kooning spent the summer at Black Mountain College near Asheville, North Carolina, where she played the title role in a production of Erik Satie\u2019s Le pi\u00e8ge de M\u00e9duse (The Ruse of Medusa, 1948), produced by John Cage and Merce Cunningham, for which she also designed the sets. Her first solo exhibition was in 1952 at the Stable Gallery, New York, where she showed again in 1954 and 1956.\nDe Kooning was a founding member of the Club, a group of avant-garde artists that met in Greenwich Village to discuss and debate art from 1949 until 1962. Though a fierce defender of Abstract Expressionism, she eventually became known for her portraits, particularly of men. After receiving a teaching appointment at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, in 1958, she traveled to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, where she saw her first bullfight. The experience inspired a series of bull paintings on horizontal canvases, rendered in a bolder palette than that of her previous work. In 1961 she was included in the Whitney Annual (later the Whitney Biennial), New York, and in 1962 was commissioned to paint John F. Kennedy\u2019s portrait, in part because of her reputation for quick execution. Despite an entire year obsessively working on the portrait, after the president\u2019s death in 1964 she ceased painting altogether for another year.\nFrom the late 1940s to the early 1980s, De Kooning painted basketball players at play using a loose, expressionistic style, and in the 1980s made a series of quasi-figurative, orgiastic paintings titled Bacchus. In 1983 she visited the Paleolithic caves in Lascaux, France, and began a series of paintings based on the cave paintings, titled Cave Walls, in which outlines of animals such as deer, bison, and goats, are rendered against turbulent grounds of dense brushstrokes. Toward the end of her life, she also made a number of works on paper in ink, continuing with the theme of cave paintings.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Brooklyn", "artistBirthDate": "1918", "artistDeathDate": "1989"}}, "92": {"paintingDate": "1931\u201332", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/76.2553.100_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

His family is one of remarkable artistic repute; he and his three siblings Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, and Suzanne Duchamp would all make important contributions to 20th-century art. While still a lyc\u00e9e student in Rouen, he began his artistic training under his grandfather, Emile Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Nicolle, a shipbroker and artist. Nicolle taught Villon engraving and printmaking, and in 1891 he was the subject of one of Villon\u2019s earliest prints. In January 1894 Villon moved in with his brother Raymond in Paris\u2019s Montmartre neighborhood and began to study law at the University of Paris. He soon lost interest in legal studies and instead spent his time submitting drawings to various magazines and newspapers, some of which were politically oriented. Partly in order to distance his family's name from these publications, he changed his name to Jacques Villon (an homage to French medieval poet Fran\u00e7ois Villon). In 1895 he began study at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and frequented the Atelier Cormon.\nFor almost 10 years Villon worked largely in graphic media, contributing drawings to Parisian illustrated papers and making color prints and posters. In 1903 he helped organize the drawing section of the first Salon d\u2019Automne, which would become one of the most significant annual exhibitions in the history of modern art. His first gallery exhibition, shared with his brother Raymond, took place at Galerie Legrip, Rouen, in 1905. He studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian in Paris between 1904 and 1905, painting in a Neo-Impressionist style. In 1906 Villon settled in Puteaux and began to spend more time painting; by 1910 he had devoted himself primarily to painterly pursuits. In 1911, he and Duchamp-Villon helped found the Puteaux Group, a collective of Cubist artists that held meetings in Villon\u2019s studio; its participants included Robert Delaunay, Marcel Duchamp, Albert Gleizes, Franti\u0161ek Kupka, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Francis Picabia, and others. The following year, working with the Puteaux Group, Villon named and helped mount the Salon de la Section d'Or, a seminal exhibition in the development of the Cubist movement. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "", "artistBirthDate": "", "artistDeathDate": "1963"}}, "558": {"paintingDate": "1958", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/59.1528_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

As a young girl she traveled widely with her affluent parents (her father was a diplomat) and encountered an array of avant-garde groups, such as the Italian Futurists and the Ballets Russes. In 1919 she entered the Academia de belas-artes, Lisbon, to study drawing with Emilia Santos Braga. She moved to Paris in 1928 to continue her formal training, enrolling in Emile-Antoine Bourdelle\u2019s sculpture course at the Acad\u00e9mie de la grande chaumi\u00e8re. While in Paris, she absorbed a variety of influences\u2014from the geometric abstraction of the group Cercle et Carr\u00e9 (Circle and Square, 1929\u201333) and Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda to the decorative style of Pierre Bonnard.\nVieira da Silva\u2019s early paintings were influenced by each of these trends, and her style melds Cubism, Futurism, and Constructivism. With its keen sense of rhythm and pattern, Vieira da Silva\u2019s early work reflects a sensitivity that would become a main component in her more mature paintings, in which a sense of deep space and perspective is maintained even as jagged shapes fracture the picture plane. She had her first solo exhibition in 1933 at the Galerie Jeanne Bucher, Paris, exhibiting illustrations from a children\u2019s book along with a few paintings. At the outbreak of World War II, Vieira da Silva and her husband, painter Arpad Szen\u00e8s, fled to Portugal before moving to Rio de Janeiro. Vieira da Silva continued to paint and exhibit in Brazil until she and Szen\u00e8s were able to return to Paris in 1947.\nThe subject matter of Vieira da Silva\u2019s 1950s paintings focuses on the postwar environment: cities that had been burned or flooded, alleyways, sunsets, and landscapes (both natural and built). Works with titles such as Canals of Holland (Canaux en Hollande, 1958), Old America (Vielle Am\u00e9rique, 1958), and Collapsed Facade (Les fa\u00e7ades \u00e9boul\u00e9es, 1957) blur the specificity of place with generic prototypes\u2014nature, culture, the city, the grid. Similar scenes are shown in endless variation, yet in each painting an underlying structure and order shines through. While primarily a painter, Vieira da Silva experimented with other mediums. In 1966 she accepted a commission to design a stained-glass window for the east chapel apse at Reims Cathedral, France. She continued to paint through the 1980s, and her later work has a notable focus on light, in both color scheme and subject matter.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Lisbon", "artistBirthDate": "1908", "artistDeathDate": "1992"}}, "555": {"paintingDate": "1955\u201379", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/84.3251_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Accardi quickly became part of the inner circle of the Art Club and was a frequent visitor to Pietro Consagra's studio. There she met the artists with whom she would establish the influential postwar group Forma 1 (Form 1, 1947\u201351): Consagra, Piero Dorazio, Mino Guerrini, Achille Perilli, Antonio Sanfilippo (whom she would marry), and Giulio Turcato. The group\u2019s manifesto, which Accardi signed in 1947, called for reconciling Marxist politics with abstract art. The group\u2019s first exhibition occurred in Rome in 1947, and Accardi's first solo show soon followed, in 1950 at the Galleria Age d\u2019or, Rome. Her early paintings consisted of interlocking geometric forms. \n In the 1950s, Accardi was involved in the wide-reaching attempts to revolutionize abstraction through the hybridization of geometric abstraction and gestural painting, both in Italy, where she appeared in Arte astratta e concreta in Italia\u20141951 (Abstract and concrete art in Italy\u20141951) at the Galleria nazionale d\u2019arte moderna, Rome, and in France, where art critic Michel Tapi\u00e9 took an interest in her work. (Tapi\u00e9 would later write the introduction to the catalogue accompanying Accardi's 1959 solo exhibition at the Galleria Notizie in Turin.) After forswearing painting from 1952 to 1953, Accardi began to introduce pseudo-calligraphic signs into abstract images, as in Labirinto a settori (Labyrinths and fields, 1957), while reducing her palette to white-on-black compositions to explore the relationship between figure and ground. \nIn 1961 Accardi reintegrated color and began painting on sicofoil, a transparent plastic, instead of canvas. She showcased these new strategies at the 1964 Venice Biennale. By the mid-1960s, she was using these new materials sculpturally. Tenda (Tent, 1965) and Triplice Tenda (Triple tent, 1969) feature sheets of plastic assembled into a tent and covered with brightly colored brushstroke patterns. This phase of Accardi's oeuvre, which was celebrated in the Ambiente/Arte section of the 1976 Venice Biennale, would prove influential for Arte Povera. In the 1980s she returned to canvas and shifted her focus to the use of signs and chromatic juxtapositions.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Trapani", "artistBirthDate": "1924", "artistDeathDate": "2014"}}, "146": {"paintingDate": "1953", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/55.1431_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In 1920, he traveled to Italy, where he was impressed by the works of Alexander Archipenko and Paul C\u00e9zanne at the Venice Biennale. He was also deeply affected by African and Egyptian art and by the masterpieces of Giotto and Tintoretto. In 1922, Giacometti settled in Paris, making frequent visits to Stampa, and occasionally attended Antoine Bourdelle\u2019s sculpture classes.\nIn 1927, the artist moved into a studio with his brother, Diego, his lifelong companion and assistant, and exhibited his sculpture for the first time at the Salon des Tuileries, Paris. His first show in Switzerland, shared with his father, was held at the Galerie Aktuaryus, Zurich, in 1927. The following year, Giacometti met Andr\u00e9 Masson, and by 1930 he was a participant in the Surrealist circle until 1934. His first solo show took place in 1932 at the Galerie Pierre Colle, Paris. In 1934, his first American solo exhibition opened at the Julien Levy Gallery, New York. During the early 1940s, he became friends with Simone de Beauvoir, Pablo Picasso, and Jean-Paul Sartre.

Measuring approximately 3 meters wide and 2 meters high, Mountains and Sea matches the ambitious scale and gestural handling associated with the New York School, but Frankenthaler's method of paint application was markedly original: she thinned the oil paint to the consistency of watercolor so that it would soak into and stain the canvas rather than accumulate on its surface. Inspired by Pollock's drip style, her soak-in technique resulted in fresh, appealing expanses of color that spurred similar experiments by Kenneth Noland and Morris Louis (whom Greenberg took to Frankenthaler's studio in 1953) and prefigured Color Field painting of the later 1950s and 1960s by Louis, Noland, Jules Olitski, and Frankenthaler herself. Though working in a milieu dominated by male artists, male critics, and a discourse centered on such \"masculine\" attributes as scale, gesture, and \"muscle,\" Frankenthaler garnered solo exhibitions at prestigious institutions, regularly received favorable reviews, and gained the respect of her peers.\nIn 1958 Frankenthaler married Robert Motherwell. At about the same time she began experimenting with the relationship between fine lines and small, sunlike shapes. In the early 1960s she started producing paintings featuring a single stain or blot; she also began to use acrylic paint to create richly colored canvases, such as Cape (Provincetown) (1964). Frankenthaler and Motherwell divorced in 1971, and several years later she bought a second home and studio in Connecticut, where she ventured into the production of welded-steel sculptures, prints, and illustrated books. Further experiments with other mediums led her to design the sets and costumes for a production by England's Royal Ballet in 1985, though she continued to focus on her painting practice during this period.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "New York City", "artistBirthDate": "1928", "artistDeathDate": "2011"}}, "143": {"paintingDate": "1944", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/47.1100_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He studied science and medicine at the University of Munich from 1910 to 1912, and later moved on to study philosophy and art history until 1914, influenced by the lectures of Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin and the philosophy of Henri Bergson. Simultaneously, he studied engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Munich, which housed a large collection of mathematical models. He moved to Norway during most of World War I, and began to produce sculptural constructions using cardboard, plywood, and iron, with the encouragement of his brother, artist Antoine Pevsner. Around this time, he adopted the surname Gabo to distinguish himself from Pevsner.\nThe two brothers returned to Russia in 1917, lured by the promise of revolution, and became active proponents of what would become known as Constructivism. While his early sculptures were figurative, he moved on to abstract, architectonic works such as Column (1920), which included its integral base. Gabo's 1920 tract, the \"Realisticheskii manifest\" (\"Realistic Manifesto\"), outlined several of his concepts of art, including the rejection of Cubism and Futurism, an embrace of public art that encompassed space and time as essential elements, and the idea that \"art has its absolute, independent value.\"\u00b9 This concept of autonomy ran counter to the Bolsheviks' doctrine of artistic utility, and prompted Gabo's departure for Berlin in 1922. There, he produced designs for Diaghilev's ballet La Chatte (The Cat) in 1926, lectured at the Bauhaus in 1928, came into contact with Hans Richter and Kurt Schwitters, and had an important solo show at the Kestner-Gesellschaft in Hannover in 1930. By 1932, Nazism drove him and Pevsner first to Paris where he joined Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation (Abstraction-Creation), in the company of Piet Mondrian and other De Stijl artists, and then to London in 1936. There he became acquainted with Herbert Read and Ben Nicholson, with whom he edited Circle in 1937. Through the industrial chemist John Sisson, he was introduced to Perspex, the new plastic developed by Imperial Chemical Industries, which he used in several iconic works, such as Translucent Variation on Spheric Theme (1937). While living in Cornwall during World War II, he continued to experiment with different media, even while some materials were in short supply: Linear Construction in Space (1942) incorporated nylon microfilament.\nIn 1946 Gabo emigrated to the United States. After a major exhibition of his work in 1948 (shared with his brother Pevsner), which provided a platform for his text \"The Philosophy of Constructivist Art,\" he began to show regularly in the U.S. and Europe and to undertake public commissions, such as his 1951 Construction Suspended in Space for the Baltimore Museum of Art. In the 1950s Gabo continued to explore scientific and mathematical images through a new medium, wood engraving, which he utilized throughout the last two decades of his life.\nGabo has been the subject of numerous exhibitions at major institutions, including a traveling retrospective at the Dallas Museum of Art; Art Gallery of Toronto; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Akademie der K\u00fcnste, Berlin; Kunstsammling Nordrhein-Westfalen, D\u00fcsseldorf; and Tate Gallery, London (1985\u201387). Other retrospectives include those held at Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo (1971); Nationalgalerie, Berlin (1971); Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne, Paris (1972); Albright-Knox Gallery, Buffalo, New York (1968); and Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (1965).

He began painting in high school, but planned to study architecture under Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. However, an influential first trip to Europe prevented Estes from applying for admission in time. He opted instead to begin his studies at the Art Institute of Chicago where he received a BFA in 1956. After graduation he lived and worked intermittently in New York as freelance graphic designer for various publishing and advertising agencies and painted in his spare time. Estes moved back to Chicago for a brief period and by 1959 had gained enough financial stability to move back to New York definitively. He continued to work as a designer and had also begun photographing the city and using these images as departure points for his paintings. In 1966, he finally left his job in advertising and committed to painting full time.\nEstes is considered one of the founding Photorealists, a group of artists who used photo-based techniques to achieve hyperrealist effects in their paintings. Estes\u2019s paintings extend beyond a mere translation of photographic verisimilitude, however; his images of urban landscapes\u2014usually of New York, though he also painted images of Venice; Florence, Italy; Barcelona; Cordova, Spain; and Hiroshima\u2014transform the light and forms captured in his photographs into a painting of allover focus and extreme precision. The exaggerated focus and luminosity of his canvases draw closer attention to previously unseen or overlooked aspects of the urban environment, encouraging viewers to interrogate the relationship between reality and vision. Unlike many of his Photorealist contemporaries, Estes did not work from projected slides and never intended his paintings to be literal translations of his images. Despite the exactitude and tightly controlled appearance of his compositions, evidence of brushstroke and scenes of depopulated New York streets point to the artist\u2019s creative modifications of his photographs. The majority of his cityscapes are also devoid of people and narrative potential. Estes generally prefers depicting familiar urban fixtures\u2014modest shop windows, signage, cars, telephone booths, and intersections\u2014to iconic landmarks, although an early work from 1966 depicts a reflection of the Flatiron building, and he later painted an image of Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Guggenheim Museum building in 1979.\nEstes\u2019s interest in representing light on transparent reflective surfaces began after he saw an exhibition of Lee Friedlander\u2019s photographic urban landscapes in 1967. He received his first solo exhibition in 1968 at the Allan Stone Gallery, New York, where he had five solo exhibitions through the early 1980s. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Estes\u2019s urban vistas took on a new level of complexity through his use of multiple photographs to reconstruct a scene. Although Estes is a primarily a painter of urban landscape, he gradually turned to other terrains, such as Machu Picchu and the coastline of Maine, as well as portraits, most notably of the Chinese American architect I.\u00a0M.\u00a0Pei and the French writer Marguerite Yourcenar, in the 1980s and 1990s.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Kewanee", "artistBirthDate": "1932", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "132": {"paintingDate": "1942", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/76.2553.80_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In 1911 Ernst became a friend of August Macke and joined the Rheinische Expressionisten group in Bonn. Ernst showed for the first time in 1912 at the Galerie Feldman in Cologne. At the Sonderbund exhibition of that year in Cologne he saw the work of Paul C\u00e9zanne, Edvard Munch, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh. In 1913 he met Guillaume Apollinaire and Robert Delaunay and traveled to Paris. Ernst participated that same year in the Erste deutsche Herbstsalon. In 1914 he met Jean Arp, who was to become a lifelong friend.\nDespite military service throughout World War I, Ernst was able to continue painting and to exhibit in Berlin at Der Sturm in 1916. He returned to Cologne in 1918. The next year he produced his first collages and founded the short-lived Cologne Dada movement with Johannes Theodor Baargeld; they were joined by Arp and others.

He worked briefly in a figurative style before he discovered Cubism, but in 1954 the Galer\u00eda Buchholz, Madrid, presented his first solo show of nonfigurative works. Thereafter, Feito remained committed to painting in an abstract mode.\nIn 1953 Feito traveled to Paris on a grant from the French government. After an exhibition at the Galerie Arnaud in 1955, he left his teaching position at the Escuela superior de bellas artes de San Fernando and relocated to Paris, where he resided for nearly 25 years. While in Paris, he had the opportunity to view work by his international contemporaries\u2014Jean Fautrier, Hans Hartung, Serge Poliakoff, and Mark Rothko particularly interested him\u2014and became acquainted with several Art Informel artists. He was also introduced to automatism and began to incorporate other materials, most notably sand, into his paintings.\nFeito nonetheless maintained close contact with the Spanish avant-garde and was a founding member of the Madrid-based group El Paso (1957\u201360), which emphasized an antiacademic, morally and socially responsible, innovative art for Spain. El Paso's manifesto articulated the group's aim to create a new spiritual state in Spanish art, recognizing the necessity to take action in the wake of a devastating civil war. \nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s, Feito's work can be characterized by a subdued, colorless palette, contrasting blacks, grays, whites, and ochers. He later introduced red into his compositions as a counterpoint, and then as the primary color in many compositions. His work from this period also exhibits his interest in materiality through his overlapping of smooth and encrusted surfaces, which he accomplished by using sand and heavy impasto. In 1963 his work tended toward an increased formal and material simplicity in which circular forms predominated, reflecting his interest in Japanese art. Throughout his career Feito has continually explored relationships among surface textures, light, color, and form. Because of his preoccupation with light, many critics have ascribed an element of mysticism to his work. In 1981 he moved to Montreal and then to New York in 1983, where he continued to live and work until the early 1990s.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Madrid", "artistBirthDate": "1929", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "134": {"paintingDate": "1915", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/54.1410_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In 1887 he traveled to Germany to pursue a career in music but studied drawing at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Hamburg instead. From 1888 to 1892, he attended the Akademie der K\u00fcnste, Berlin, and worked as a caricaturist for magazines both in the US (Harper\u2019s Round Table) and Germany (Fliegende Bl\u00e4tter). In 1906\u20137, while staying in Paris, he worked for the French satirical weekly Le T\u00e9moin, and published the weekly comic strip The Kin-Der-Kids in the Chicago Sunday Tribune.\nUpon his return to Berlin in 1907, Feininger began to work on easel paintings and drawings depicting architectural subjects and street scenes, as seen in Carnival (1908). After encountering Cubism and the works of the Orphist painter Robert Delaunay during a 1911 trip to Paris, Feininger created woodcuts and paintings of buildings and ships at sea, using semitransparent planes whose intersections produce prismatic effects. In 1913, at the invitation of the German Expressionists\u2019 group Der Blaue Reiter, which had been founded in 1911 by Vasily Kandinsky and Franz Marc, he participated in the Erster deutscher Herbstsalon at Herwarth Walden\u2019s Der Sturm gallery in Berlin, where he also had his first solo exhibition in 1917. At the end of 1918, he met Walter Gropius who asked him to teach at the newly founded Bauhaus school in Weimar. Feininger became the Bauhaus\u2019s first form master and the head of its print workshop, and his 1919 woodcut, Cathedral, illustrated the school\u2019s manifesto. In Weimar, he worked on paintings such as Church of the Minorities II (1926), whose structural order reflects the organizational principles of classical architecture and of his own musical compositions, especially his fugues for organ. In works like Gelmeroda (1913\u201336), a series of oil paintings based on the medieval church near Weimar, prismatic planes form dynamic constructions producing a sense of monumentality.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "New York", "artistBirthDate": "1871", "artistDeathDate": "1956"}}, "494": {"paintingDate": "1999", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2000.67_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Instead, he attended the Chouinard Art Institute (now California Institute of the Arts), Los Angeles, from 1956 to 1960. Ruscha began his career as a graphic artist but expanded his production to encompass drawing, painting, photography, and artist books that explore the banality of the urban landscape.\nRuscha\u2019s works function as alternatives to mass-media depictions of life in Los Angeles and on the West Coast. His early interest in commercial art and work as a graphic designer and layout artist for an L.A. advertising agency, as well as his distrust and frustration with the traditional hierarchies of painting and sculpture led him to create works that challenged prevalent styles such as Abstract Expressionism. Resisting the labels of Pop or Conceptual artist, Ruscha nevertheless incorporates elements of both movements into his paintings and photographs, and his work influenced the development of later Conceptual art in the United States, serving as a forerunner to that of practitioners as varied as Bruce Nauman, Robert Smithson, and Lawrence Weiner.

He began painting in 1944 after being diagnosed with spinal tuberculosis, resulting from a U.S. Army Air Corps accident. In 1947 he studied privately with painter David Park, and soon gave up his intended medical studies, earning a BA in 1949 and an MA in 1950 at the University of California, Berkeley.\nHe experimented with the dominant and emerging styles of the late 1940s, particularly Abstract Expressionism and Surrealism, eventually developing a personal style of abstraction focused on dripping, cell-like forms, an allover instability, and sensitivity to color and light, as in Opposites (1950). In 1950 Francis moved to Paris and attended the Atelier Fernand L\u00e9ger, where he was exposed to the work of Pierre Bonnard and Henri Matisse, which reinvigorated his interest in light and vibrant color, visible in his 1953 painting Big Red. Producing such work led to his association with Art Informel, although Francis never fully associated with any movement. A visit to Japan in 1957 coincided with an opening up of expanses of white space in much of his work, and his subsequent move to a larger studio in Paris resulted in the production of large-scale paintings and mural commissions, including a 1959 painting for the Chase Manhattan Bank, New York. \nFrancis returned to California in 1962 and resumed painting with combinations of bright colors. Clement Greenberg's landmark exhibition Post Painterly Abstraction (1964) at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which focused on paintings emphasizing color over gesture, included works by Francis. In the late 1960s, however, color increasingly vanished from his canvases. In 1973 he formed a lithography production company, which published his own prints. Over the next decades, Francis's style in painting and print production evolved from the depiction of bright, centrally placed shapes evocative of Tibetan mandalas (influenced by Jungian psychology) to his late-1970s exploration of more severe grid structures to a 1980s fascination with snakelike forms and colorful drips. His final decades of artistic production paralleled a succession of publishing, nonprofit, and visionary enterprises: in addition to his lithography studio, Francis formed a wind harvesting and alternative energy company in 1975; helped organize the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 1980; formed the Lapis Press, which focused on eclectic scholarship, in 1984; created a naturopathy-based medical research center in 1987; and founded the Sam Francis Art Museum in 1990 to perpetuate his artistic legacy and support charitable donations.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "San Mateo", "artistBirthDate": "1923", "artistDeathDate": "1994"}}, "138": {"paintingDate": "1959", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/77.2322_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

From 1906 to 1907, Nolde was a member of the Dresden-based German Expressionist group Die Br\u00fccke (founded by, among others, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff), and in 1910, he participated in the launch of the Neue Secession, an association of Expressionist artists in Berlin.\nNolde\u2019s interest in religious mysticism is manifested in paintings such as the nine-panel work The Life of Christ (Das Leben Christi, 1911\u201312) and Maria Aegyptiaca (1912), a triptych resembling medieval painting cycles and manuscripts and featuring bold colors and ghostly, masklike faces executed with deliberate crudeness. His works on paper\u2014such as The Prophet (Der Prophet, 1912), an emblematic work of German Expressionist printmaking\u2014similarly feature spiritual themes and have an often rudimentary quality informed by his appreciation for non-Western art and the work of James Ensor and Edvard Munch. Following a trip with an ethnological expedition to German New Guinea via Russia, China, and Southeast Asia in 1913\u201314, Nolde moved to the Baltic coast of Germany, settling in 1927 in Seeb\u00fcll, where he led a solitary life and worked on portraits, atmospheric landscapes, and paintings of flowers such as Large Sunflowers (Grosse Sonnenblumen, 1928). In 1927 a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of his graphic works from 1910 to 1925 was published in Berlin by Euphorion Verlag. Despite his support of the National Socialist Party during the 1920s and early \u201930s, his work was included in the 1937 traveling exhibition Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art), and in 1941 he was banned from painting by the Nazi regime. From 1938 until the end of World War II, Nolde created his so-called \u201cunpainted pictures,\u201d mainly small-format watercolors. In the postwar period, he repainted some of them in oil and also worked on a series of self-portraits. Nolde died on April 15, 1956, in Seeb\u00fcll.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "", "artistBirthDate": "", "artistDeathDate": "1956"}}, "406": {"paintingDate": "1964", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/81.2812_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In 1897 she attended the Damen-Kunstschule (Ladies Art School) in D\u00fcsseldorf. She traveled with her sister in the United States for the following two years, visiting relatives in Missouri, Arkansas, and Texas. By 1901 she had returned to Germany and resumed her studies at the K\u00fcnstlerinnenschule (School of Women Artists) in Munich. At this time the official academies in D\u00fcsseldorf and Munich did not admit women. In 1902 M\u00fcnter began studying under Vasily Kandinsky at the art school of the Phalanx group in Munich. \nM\u00fcnter's relationship with Kandinsky soon developed into an intimate companionship that would last for 14 years, until 1916. From 1904 to 1908 the two artists traveled throughout Europe and North Africa, spending more than a year in France. In 1909 M\u00fcnter joined the Neue K\u00fcnstlervereinigung M\u00fcnchen (NKVM; New Artists' Association of Munich), but she withdrew from the group to join Kandinsky and German artist Franz Marc in the newly formed group Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) in 1911.\nAlso in 1909, M\u00fcnter purchased a house in Murnau, in the Bavarian countryside just outside Munich, where she and Kandinsky would spend every summer until the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. At that time Kandinsky, still a Russian citizen, was abruptly forced to leave Germany and return to his native country. M\u00fcnter initially joined her companion in exile, but the two artists soon parted ways. Her relationship with Kandinsky ended definitively in 1917. \nM\u00fcnter subsequently stopped painting and traveled extensively for some ten years. In 1927 she met art historian Johannes Eichner, who became her lifelong companion. The two returned to Murnau in 1930, where M\u00fcnter lived and worked until her death. Despite the limitations on artistic experimentation legislated and enforced by the National Socialist (Nazi) party, M\u00fcnter continued to paint landscapes, portraits, and still lifes. In 1937, an exhibition of her work at the Kunstverein M\u00fcnchner (Munich Art Association) was closed by the local Nazi district leader. After the war, the Braunschweiger Kunstverein (Brunswick Art Association) mounted a retrospective of her work in 1948, and in 1956 she was awarded the Culture Prize in Painting by the city of Munich. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Berlin", "artistBirthDate": "1877", "artistDeathDate": "1962"}}, "409": {"paintingDate": "1954", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/54.1407_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

At a young age he wanted to become a painter, although his father, a successful industrialist, urged him to pursue a more practical career. In 1922 he enrolled at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, but just two years later his fascination with Western art movements led him to Paris, where he briefly studied with the Japanese artist Foujita Tsuguharu (L\u00e9onard Foujita) and exhibited in the 1927 Salon d'Automne. On Okada's return to Japan that year, his work received favorable critical response, resulting in his first solo exhibition at the Galerie Nichido, Tokyo, in 1929, where he continued to exhibit until 1935. In 1936 the group Nika-kai (Second-Section Society), the largest association of Japanese contemporary artists, awarded him a prestigious prize. He also had a number of teaching posts in Japanese universities, including the School of Fine Arts, Nippon University; Musashino Art Institute; and the Tama Fine Arts College, all Tokyo.\nOkada continued to paint in a Western figurative tradition, particularly impressionistic landscapes, for the next 20 years while in Japan. After World WarII, however, Okada felt dissatisfied with the Japanese contemporary art scene and left for New York in 1950. There he met Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still, as well as other artists associated with what would later become known as Abstract Expressionism. His geographical move also marked a decisive shift toward abstraction, although he never entirely abandoned figuration. For Okada the binary opposition between figuration and abstraction was irrelevant, a product of a Western mind-set, yet he insisted that Abstract Expressionism's emphasis on the subconscious became a conduit for his exploration of his cultural heritage.\nSpecific elements of Japanese culture, such as 17th-century screen painting, Zen Buddhism, and ancient No theater, are prominent in his postwar paintings. The influence of nature can be seen in his delicate and subdued palette, as in the earth tones of Decision (1956), as well as in his process. He often used natural materials such as rocks and sticks to help visualize and structure his compositions. In the 1960s critics drew comparisons between his allover paintings and the work of Color Field artists such as Helen Frankenthaler and Jules Olitski. He became a U.S. citizen in 1960.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "", "artistBirthDate": "", "artistDeathDate": "1982"}}, "408": {"paintingDate": "1955", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/55.1422_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

During World War II, he attended the Tokyo School of Fine Arts for three years, studying under painter Gen\u2019ichir\u014d Inokuma. Precipitated by expanding postwar communication between Japan and the United States, Ohashi continued his studies in Boston at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts (1950\u201355). Betty Parsons, the famed art dealer whose eponymous New York gallery gave many American avant-garde artists their first solo exhibitions, visited Ohashi\u2019s Boston studio in 1955 and expressed interest in his work, though nothing immediately came of this new connection. Shortly after his first solo exhibition at Boston\u2019s Margaret Brown Gallery in fall 1955, where he debuted paintings embellished with gold and collage elements, Ohashi received a two-year work-study fellowship in Europe. While abroad, Ohashi\u2019s paintings were displayed in group shows at the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, Massachusetts (1956); Art Institute of Chicago (1957); and Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (1957).\nParsons\u2019s continued enthusiasm for Ohashi\u2019s paper-collage paintings and the growing exposure of his work led to the artist\u2019s 1959\u201360 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship and move to New York. There he found a community of artists who were synthesizing the action-centric aesthetic of Abstract Expressionism with the flat, decorative traditions of Japanese painting. Artists including Inokuma, Sabur\u014d Hasegawa, Minoru Niizuma, and Kenzo Okada experimented with gestural abstraction and improvisation in their paintings while Americans Sam Francis, Franz Kline, and others conversely adopted Japanese visual techniques such as the emphasis on negative space and the lyrical brushstroke. Ohashi was known for paintings that integrated the restrained, purposeful act of collage, adding texture and changing registers of density to large, encompassing abstract forms. He added semitransparent layers of rice paper to the foreground of his paintings and, at times, partly obscured the rice paper with layers of oil paint. This technique, combined with large swaths of negative space and occasional highlights in gold leaf, contributes to fluctuating perceptions of space within Ohashi\u2019s compositions.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Hiroshima", "artistBirthDate": "1923", "artistDeathDate": "1989"}}, "379": {"paintingDate": "1926", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/37.354_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Mir\u00f3 received early encouragement from the dealer Jos\u00e9 Dalmau, who gave him his first solo show at his gallery in Barcelona in 1918. In 1917 he met Francis Picabia.\nIn 1920 Mir\u00f3 made his first trip to Paris, where he met Pablo Picasso. From this time, Mir\u00f3 divided his time between Paris and Montroig, Spain. In Paris he associated with the poets Max Jacob, Pierre Reverdy, and Tristan Tzara and participated in Dada activities. Dalmau organized Mir\u00f3\u2019s first solo show in Paris, at the Galerie la Licorne in 1921. His work was included in the Salon d\u2019Automne of 1923. In 1924 Mir\u00f3 joined the Surrealist group. His solo show at the Galerie Pierre, Paris, in 1925 was a major Surrealist event; Mir\u00f3 was included in the first Surrealist exhibition at the Galerie Pierre that same year. He visited the Netherlands in 1928 and began a series of paintings inspired by Dutch masters. That year he also executed his first papiers coll\u00e9s (pasted papers) and collages. In 1929 he started his experiments in lithography, and his first etchings date from 1933. During the early 1930s he made Surrealist sculptures incorporating painted stones and found objects.

He spent his childhood in the Normandy coastal town of Le Havre, where his father prospered as a grocer and ship chandler. In 1860 Monet met the landscape artist Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, who introduced him to plein-air painting, and he began to produce increasingly ambitious and naturalistic work.\nIn 1859 Monet moved to Paris, where he attended the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse beginning in 1860. He returned to Le Havre in 1862 and worked in the plein-air mode alongside Boudin and Dutch painter Johan Barthold Jongkind. In 1862 he returned to Paris to enroll in the studio of Charles Gleyre, where his fellow students included Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille and Alfred Sisley. Despite some success in 1865, when two of his works were exhibited at the Salon, by 1867 financial difficulties forced Monet to return to his family in Le Havre, leaving his pregnant companion, Camille-L\u00e9onie Doncieux, in Paris, where she gave birth to their first son, Jean. The couple were married in 1870; soon after, in response to the Franco-Prussian War, they left for London. There Monet met Paul Durand-Ruel, who would later become his gallerist and a champion of Impressionism. After returning to France at the end of 1871 Monet and his family settled in Argenteuil.\nIn 1874, having banded together with other artists to form the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Artistes, Monet submitted his painting Impression, Sunrise (1872, Mus\u00e9e Marmottan, Paris) to the group's first exhibition. The work caused a sensation, and gave a name to the burgeoning movement, when the critic Louis Leroy lampooned the group as \u201cimpressionists,\u201d a term the artists themselves soon adopted without satirical inflection.\nIn 1878, with financial troubles looming and his wife gravely ill, the Monets embarked on an unorthodox joint household arrangement in V\u00e9theuil with the family of former patron Ernest Hosched\u00e9. After Camille\u2019s death, Monet and Alice Hosched\u00e9 continued to live together, waiting until Ernest Hosched\u00e9 died before marrying in 1892. Monet continued to exhibit with the Impressionists on an irregular basis, choosing also to show his work at the Salon in 1880, in a solo exhibition at Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris in 1883, and at several of Georges Petit\u2019s Expositions Internationales de Peinture. In 1889 Galerie Georges Petit staged a major retrospective of his work, showing 145 paintings. Two years later Durand-Ruel mounted an exhibition of Monet's first series paintings, Grainstacks, which were met with great critical acclaim. The artist continued his exploration of series in his paintings of poplars and of the Rouen Cathedral, documenting in a succession of canvases subtle shifts in light or focus.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Paris", "artistBirthDate": "1840", "artistDeathDate": "1926"}}, "82": {"paintingDate": "1923\u201324", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/37.446_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

From 1947 to 1951, Cicero attended the New Jersey State Teachers College (now Kean University), Newark, and in 1953, he briefly pursued graduate work in painting at Hunter College, New York, studying under Hans Hofmann and Robert Motherwell. The two abstract painters and their circle of artists, poets, and musicians were immensely influential for Cicero, whose singular explorations of abstraction coalesced within the overarching New York school of his teachers and friends. \nCicero's early work combined the gestures of Abstract Expressionism with the artist's interest in Surrealist automatism. Many of his paintings were first executed in light brushstrokes, free-associating shapes with geographic locations or literary motifs, such as the mountains of Catalonia (in Near Tibidabo, 1950) or the strange creatures of Franz Kafka (in Odradek, 1959). The artist would work his black-and-white compositions further, adding the sharp lines and erratic forms that distinguished his oeuvre in the 1950s. \nIn 1957, Cicero had his first solo exhibition at Peridot Gallery, New York, the gallery that exhibited the works of Louise Bourgeois and Philip Guston in solo shows a decade prior; Peridot continued to exhibit Cicero's abstractions through 1969. His work was also shown at such venues as the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1953, 1955, 1957); Newark Museum (1955, 1964, 1966, 1967); Art Institute of Chicago (1957); Fine Arts Pavilion, New York World's Fair (1964); Whitney Annual (later the Whitney Biennial), New York (1955, 1957, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1966); as well as the Guggenheim Museum's 1959 exhibition inaugurating its Frank Lloyd Wright\u2013designed building. In 1957 and again in 1963, he was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship.

In 1949, Kelly went to France and enrolled at the \u00c9cole des beaux-arts, Paris, under the GI Bill, although he attended classes infrequently. In France, he discovered Romanesque art and architecture as well as Byzantine art. He was also introduced to Surrealism and Neo-Plasticism, which led him to experiment with automatic drawing and geometric abstraction. In his work Kelly abstracts the forms in his paintings from observations of the real world, such as shadows cast by trees or the spaces between architectural elements. \nIn 1950, Kelly met Jean Arp and that same year began to make shaped-wood reliefs and collages in which elements were arranged according to the laws of chance. He soon began to make paintings in separate panels that could be recombined to produce alternate compositions, as well as multipanel paintings in which each canvas is painted a single color. During the 1950s, he traveled throughout France, where he met Constantin Brancusi, Alexander Calder, Alberto Magnelli, Francis Picabia, and Georges Vantongerloo, among other artists. His first solo show took place at the Galerie Arnaud Lefebvre, Paris, in 1951.\nKelly returned to the United States in 1954, living first in a studio apartment on Broad Street, New York, and then at Coenties Slip in lower Manhattan, where his neighbors would through the years include Robert Indiana, Agnes Martin, Fred Mitchell, James Rosenquist, Lenore Tawney, and Jack Youngerman. Kelly continued to develop and expand the vocabulary of painting, exploring issues of form and ground with his flatly painted canvases. His first solo show in New York was held at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1956, and three years later he was included in 16 Americans at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York. In 1958, he also began to make freestanding sculptures. In 1959, art historian Jules Langsner termed the current of American geometric abstraction \"Hard-edge painting,\" connoting the shaped panels of bright color and rigid form created by Kelly and his contemporaries.

In 1947 he moved to Le Pecq, a Parisian suburb, and his art was included in an exhibition of works by his Parisian compatriots Fran\u00e7ois Arnal, Georges Mathieu, Pierre Soulages, Kumi Suga\u00ef, and others at Galerie Schmela, D\u00fcsseldorf.

He attended the Kunstgewerbeschule in Hannover from 1908 to 1909 and from 1909 to 1914 studied at the Kunstakademie Dresden. After serving as a draftsman in the military in 1917, Schwitters experimented with Cubist and Expressionist styles. In 1918, he made his first collages and in 1919 invented the term \u201cMerz,\u201d which he was to apply to all his creative activities: poetry as well as collage and constructions. This year also marked the beginning of his friendships with Jean Arp and Raoul Hausmann. Schwitters\u2019s earliest Merzbilder date from 1919, the year of his first exhibition at Der Sturm gallery, Berlin, and the first publication of his writings in the periodical Der Sturm. Schwitters showed at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme in New York in 1920.\nWith Arp, he attended the Kongress der Konstructivisten in Weimar in 1922. There Schwitters met Theo van Doesburg, whose De Stijl principles influenced his work. Schwitters\u2019s Dada activities included his Merz-Matineen and Merz-Abende at which he presented his poetry. From 1923 to 1932, he published the magazine Merz. About 1923, the artist started to make his first Merzbau, a fantastic structure he built over a number of years; the Merzbau grew to occupy much of his Hannover studio. During this period, he also worked in typography. Schwitters was included in the exhibition Abstrakte und surrealistische Malerei und Plastik at the Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich in 1929. The artist contributed to the Parisian review Cercle et Carr\u00e9 in 1930. In 1932, he joined the Paris-based Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation group and wrote for their organ of the same name.

After a year of military service on the Breton coast, Seurat returned to Paris. From the late 1870s his interest in current scientific theories about color perception and chromatics grew, and by 1881, he had studied Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors (1839) by Michel-Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul and treatises by Charles Blank, Thomas Couture, Ogden N.

In 1884 after being rejected by the Salon, he, with Henri-Edmond Cross, Maximilian Luce, Odilon Redon, and Paul Signac, founded the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. With Cross and Signac, Seurat developed Divisionism (the term he preferred to Pointilism), breaking down colors into their constituent hues and applying them side by side on canvas. In Seurat's method, which he also called peinture optique, colors placed next to each other were intended to mix in the eye of the viewer and approximate the quality of natural light. In 1886 Seurat met mathematician and scientist Charles Henry. Vocal in his ideas about the interconnections between aesthetics and science, Henry influenced Seurat\u2019s desire to logically control color and space and his later attempts to find methodical, scientific means of composition.\nIn addition to numerous smaller works, Seurat created seven major paintings, the best-known of which is perhaps Sunday Afternoon on the Island of the Grande Jatte (1884\u201386, Art Institute of Chicago) first exhibited in the Eighth Impressionist Exhibition in 1886. Throughout the late 1880s, he summered on the Channel coast, working outdoors from the landscape and following the example of Impressionism in selecting his subject matter.

After a year of military service on the Breton coast, Seurat returned to Paris. From the late 1870s his interest in current scientific theories about color perception and chromatics grew, and by 1881, he had studied Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors (1839) by Michel-Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul and treatises by Charles Blank, Thomas Couture, Ogden N.

He studied at the Escuela de artes pl\u00e1sticas in Caracas from 1942 to 1947 and then served as director of the Escuela de bellas artes in Maracaibo, Venezuela, until 1950, at which time he moved to Paris. There he associated with Yaacov Agam, Jean Tinguely, and Victor Vasarely, as well as artists connected to Galerie Denise Ren\u00e9 and the Nouveau R\u00e9alistes (New Realists). Having started out as an illusionistic painter, in 1955 Soto participated in Le mouvement (The Movement) at Galerie Denise Ren\u00e9, the exhibition that effectively launched Kinetic art. Around this time, and for many years subsequently, Soto\u2019s art oscillated between geometric and organic forms. His work is often associated with Venezuelan Op art because the serial geometric forms of his paintings of the 1950s bear an affinity to works from that later movement. By 1957 Soto had moved toward a more gestural abstraction, but by 1965 he had returned definitively to a geometric idiom. During the same decade, he began making linear, kinetic constructions using industrial and synthetic materials such as nylon, Perspex, steel, and industrial paint.\nMajor exhibitions of Soto\u2019s work took place at Signals Gallery, London (1965); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1971); Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York (1974); and Mus\u00e9e national d\u2019art moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (1979). For each of these exhibitions, Soto used swaying nylon thread or plastic string to turn the gallery space into an all-encompassing, kinetic installation, in which the experience of the spectator within the constructed environment was central to the work\u2019s meaning. Soto\u2019s sculptures and environments often play with the juxtaposition of solid and void, deliberately unsettling the act of viewing by blurring the distinction between reality and illusion.\nIn 1969 UNESCO commissioned Soto to create two murals for their buildings in Paris. Over the next few decades, several more commissions followed, including two in his native Venezuela: one in the Chaca\u00edto metro station in Caracas, and the other on the ceiling of the Teatro Teresa Carre\u00f1o, also in Caracas. In 1973 the Museo de arte moderno Jes\u00fas Soto, which houses works by Soto along with works by international avant-garde artists he admired, including Jean Arp, Kazimir Malevich, and Man Ray, opened in his birth city of Ciudad Bol\u00edvar.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Ciudad Bolivar", "artistBirthDate": "1923", "artistDeathDate": "2005"}}, "516": {"paintingDate": "1915", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/44.944_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He spent his childhood in Valhalla, New York, and then briefly attended Bard College in the Hudson River Valley, New York, in 1936. When he was 20 years old, Pousette-Dart moved to New York to pursue a career as an artist. Just one year later, in 1937, he became an assistant to Art Deco sculptor Paul Manship and subsequently worked as a secretary in Lynn Morgan's photography studio until 1939. The latter appointment instilled a passion for photography that would remain with the artist even after he chose painting as his primary medium.\nIn 1941 the Artists' Gallery, New York, hosted Poussette-Dart's first solo exhibition, and soon after he was showing his work at many of the galleries that supported the first generation of Abstract Expressionists. He was included in the inaugural Forty American Moderns exhibition at Howard Putzel's 67 Gallery in 1944 and had solo shows at Peggy Guggenheim's gallery-museum Art of This Century in 1947 and Betty Parsons Gallery the following year. Pousette-Dart quarried many of the same sources, including Surrealism and Jungian psychology, as his fellow Abstract Expressionist painters, and his early efforts are similarly indebted to the work of Pablo Picasso and the art of non-Western cultures in their use of totemic forms, emphatic color, and pronounced gestural brushwork. Although he appeared with some of the major figures of the movement\u2014including Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, and Clyfford Still, in a now-famous 1951 Life magazine photograph that labeled the group the \"Irascibles\"\u2014Pousette-Dart usually preferred to work in solitude, without public attention. He resided outside New York, first in Sloatsburg, New York, from 1951, and then in Suffern, New York, from 1958, which further contributed to this widespread perception of his independence from his colleagues. His move to the country also reflects the influence of Eastern philosophy and American transcendentalism on his artistic practice.\nPousette-Dart was continually invested in the formal nature of his medium, and in the early 1950s he made a series of paintings using a variety of white paints, primarily titanium and permalba, reworking old canvases and thinly painting on top of previous impasto. He also began to create abstract works in bright colors and reduced, geometric forms that have been likened to mosaics. His early work, often marked by black contour lines and mythical subject matter, evolved to become increasingly light in tone and more focused on spiritual ideals. From the 1960s he developed a dotted, almost pointillist style to create works dedicated to the exploration of color, texture, and form. He pursued these foundational concerns in his later work, creating into his eighth decade works that conveyed a harmony of universal forms. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "St. Paul", "artistBirthDate": "1916", "artistDeathDate": "1992"}}, "456": {"paintingDate": "1923", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/46.1020_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He entered the Institut Industriel du Nord in Lille to study chemistry in 1920 but left the following year to become an architectural apprentice in Paris. He painted while working as an architectural draftsman in the early 1920s. H\u00e9lion attracted the attention of the collector Georges Bine in 1925 and was soon able to devote himself entirely to painting. In 1927 he met Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda, who collaborated on L'Acte, a short-lived magazine founded by H\u00e9lion and others.\nH\u00e9lion first exhibited at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1928. Shortly thereafter he became acquainted with Jean Arp, Piet Mondrian, and Antoine Pevsner. By 1929 his work was nonfigurative. With Theo van Doesburg and others in 1930 he formed the artists' association Art Concret and the periodical of the same name. This group was succeeded by Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation the next year. In 1931, after traveling through Europe and the Soviet Union, H\u00e9lion returned to Paris, where he met Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, and Tristan Tzara. His first solo show was held at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1932. That same year H\u00e9lion made his first visit to New York, where he was given a solo exhibition at the John Becker Gallery at the end of 1933. After returning to Europe from a second trip to the United States in 1934, he met Jacques Lipchitz, Joan Mir\u00f3, and Ben Nicholson. In 1936 he settled in the United States, dividing his time between Virginia and New York. That year solo shows of his work took place at the Galerie Cahiers d'Art in Paris and the Valentine Gallery in New York. The artist traveled to Paris in 1938 on the occasion of his solo exhibition at the Galerie Pierre, and he became a friend of Paul Eluard, Matta, and Yves Tanguy. In 1939, he began integrating figurative elements into his work.

After serving in the U.S. Navy from 1945 to 1947, Held associated with members of the activist group Folksay who viewed art as a forceful medium for political and social protest. Held had also cultivated an interest in visual art, primarily through film, and enrolled in classes at the Arts Students League in 1948 on a stipend from the G.I. Bill. Held\u2019s radical convictions were nurtured by his father\u2019s Marxist beliefs and regular household political discussions. His earliest work was entirely figurative and shows the influence of Social Realism. Held had planned to study in Mexico with the renowned muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, whose works\u2019 monumental scale and expressive political content inspired him, but was unable to attend after the school lost its G.I. accreditation. Held opted to study instead at the Acad\u00e9mie de la grande chaumi\u00e8re in Paris. Before leaving for France, Held was impressed by Jackson Pollock\u2019s paintings in New York, but it was not until he arrived in Paris that he completely abandoned figuration.\nIn Paris Held took classes with the sculptor Ossip Zadkine at the academy and became part of the American expatriate circle that included artists Sam Francis, Ellsworth Kelly, Joan Mitchell, Haywood \u201cBill\u201d Rivers, and George Sugarman, among others. Held received his first solo exhibition of small abstract works in Paris at the artist-run Galerie Huit in 1952. On his return to New York, Held quickly entered the orbit of Abstract Expressionist painters, particularly Franz Kline and Mark Rothko who mentored the younger Held. His post-Paris paintings of the 1950s were heavily impastoed, tactile canvases that retain the expressive gesture of Abstract Expressionism. He received his first New York solo exhibition at the Poindexter Gallery in 1959.\nHeld is considered a prominent figure among second-generation Abstract Expressionists, but his persistent exploration of illusionistic potential within abstraction and theoretical attitudes consistently defied many of the labels of post\u2013Abstract Expressionist movements. In the early 1960s, Held\u2019s paintings moved toward a growing sense of overall clarity and concreteness. Because of their sharpened contours, increasingly geometric forms, and gradually enlarged scale, he was associated with practitioners of Hard-edge painting such as Kelly and Frank Stella. However, Held remained distinct for his bold rejection of critic Clement Greenberg\u2019s modernist doctrine, particularly its insistence on flatness. In 1967, Held became tired of the reductive geometric quality and flatness of his work and strove to incorporate space and volume into his canvases. His paintings of 1967\u201368 were exclusively black and white; after this point he began to explore the three dimensionality of the canvas by punching holes in it and structuring his compositions using vanishing points. After 1978, he began to experiment with vibrant colors in his illusionistic geometric compositions. Despite the shifts in Held\u2019s evolving logic to reconcile ordered abstraction and illusionism, the dimensions of his canvases remained a constant throughout his career. Held\u2019s persistent drive for architectural scale also found expression in several noteworthy murals, the first of which, I and We (1967), was commissioned for Walter Gropius\u2019s Tower East in Cleveland. In 2005 Held completed a mural for the New York City Subway system; he died later that year at his home in Todi, Italy.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Brooklyn", "artistBirthDate": "1928", "artistDeathDate": "2005"}}, "177": {"paintingDate": "1962", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2012.61_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In March 1948 Hanta\u00ef obtained a government grant to pursue his studies in Paris where he arrived in September 1948, following a summer of traveling in Italy. After learning that his grant was revoked due to the escalating Sovietization of Hungary, he chose to stay as an immigrant. His early 1950s paintings feature figures in landscape, biomorphic and geometric forms, and imaginary creatures as well as a series of collages and cutouts. Using procedures such as scraping, rubbing, overpainting, and drips, he merged the iconography and the automatic techniques of Surrealism with the material and the gestural approaches of Art Brut, Art Informel, and Lyrical Abstraction (Abstraction lyrique).\nAfter meeting Andr\u00e9 Breton in December 1952, Hanta\u00ef became associated with the Parisian Surrealists and had his first solo exhibition in January 1953 at the L\u2019\u00c9toile scell\u00e9e, the group\u2019s recently inaugurated gallery. The Surrealist works expand on his biomorphic imagery; they also incorporate found objects and present monstrous and often erotic half-human, half-animal beings. In March 1955, Hanta\u00ef broke with Breton\u2019s group and abandoned figurative painting. His large-scale gestural abstractions informed by the work of Georges Mathieu and the Abstract Expressionists were first shown in May 1956 at the Galerie Kl\u00e9ber, Paris, under the title Sexe-Prime: Homage to Jean-Pierre Brisset (Sexe-Prime: Hommage \u00e0 Jean-Pierre Brisset).

From 1958 to 1989, he produced \u00c9criture rose (Pink writing), a monumental canvas consisting of hand-copied, multicolored texts as well as canvases formed by painting, grattage (scraping), and handwriting. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Bia", "artistBirthDate": "1922", "artistDeathDate": "2008"}}, "174": {"paintingDate": "1987", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/87.3550_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He began his formal training at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, from which he graduated in 1971. During that time, Halley read Josef Albers\u2019s Interaction of Color (1981), which would influence him throughout his career. From 1973 to 1974 Halley lived in New Orleans, where he absorbed the vibrant cultural influences of the city, began using commercial materials in his art, and first became acquainted with the writings of earthwork artist Robert Smithson. In 1975 the artist graduated from Yale University, New Haven, with a degree in art history. After Yale, Halley returned to New Orleans, where he received an MFA in painting from the University of New Orleans in 1978. He had his first solo exhibition at the Contemporary Art Center, New Orleans, that same year.\nIn 1978 Halley spent a semester teaching art at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette. He has continued to teach throughout his career. In 1980, Halley moved back to New York and had his first solo exhibition in the city at PS122 Gallery. At this time, Halley was drawn to the pop themes and social issues addressed in New Wave music. Inspired by New York\u2019s intense urban environment, Halley set out to use the language of geometric abstraction to describe the actual geometricized space around him. He also began his iconic use of fluorescent Day-Glo paint.\nIn 1984, Halley started to exhibit with the International With Monument gallery, becoming closely associated with the organization and its artists, who exhibited conceptually rigorous work in a market-savvy, coolly presented space that stood in stark contrast to the bohemian, Neo-Expressionist flair of the East Village art scene at the time. In 1986, an exhibition of four artists from International With Monument at the Sonnabend Gallery in New York heralded the group\u2019s growing success. By the late 1980s, Halley was exhibiting with prominent galleries in the United States and Europe. In 1989, an exhibition of his paintings traveled to the Museum Haus Esters, Krefeld, Germany; Maison de la culture et de la communication de Saint-\u00c9tienne, France; and Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. From 1991 to 1992, a retrospective toured Europe, with presentations at the CAPC Mus\u00e9e d\u2019art contemporain de Bordeaux, France; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019art contemporain, Lausanne, Switzerland; Museo nacional centro de arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Madrid; and Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. In 1992, the Des Moines Art Center hosted his first solo exhibition at a U.S. museum.\nWhile developing his visual language, Halley became interested in French post-structuralist writers, including Jean Baudrillard, Guy Debord, Michel Foucault, and Paul Virillio, all of whom shared his concern with the character of social spaces in a post-industrial society. In 1981, he published his first essay \u201cBeat, Minimalism, New Wave, and Robert Smithson\u201d in Arts, a New York\u2013based magazine that would publish eight of his essays before the decade\u2019s end. Halley\u2019s writings became the basis for Neo-Geometric Conceptualism (also known as Neo-Geo), the offshoot of Neo-Conceptualism associated with the work of Ashley Bickerton, Halley, and Jeff Koons. In 1988, the artist\u2019s writings were anthologized in Collected Essays, 1981\u20131987, and again in 1997 in a second anthology, Recent Essays, 1990\u20131996.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "New York City", "artistBirthDate": "1953", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "173": {"paintingDate": "1961", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/64.1683_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

From 1930 to 1934 he attended art classes at the Escuela de artes y oficios in Granada, and in 1940, following his friend Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s advice, he moved to Madrid, where he continued his studies at the Escuela superior de bellas artes de San Fernando (now Real academia de bellas artes de San Fernando). On completing art school in 1945, Guerrero received a grant from the French government to study fresco painting for one year at the \u00c9cole des beaux-arts, Paris, where he experienced firsthand the works of Juan Gris, Joan Mir\u00f3, and Pablo Picasso, and became particularly interested in those of Henri Matisse. The landscapes and rural scenes Guerrero painted on his return to Spain reflect Matisse\u2019s profound influence on his work.\nStarting in 1946 Guerrero embraced the life of a wanderer and spent several years traveling across Europe, staying in Bern, Brussels, London, Paris, and Rome. In Rome he befriended Afro (Afro Balsadella) and his brother Mirko (Mirko Balsadella), and he met Roxanne Whittier Pollock, the American journalist he would marry in 1949. This same year, the couple moved to the United States, staying in Philadelphia first and settling in New York a year later.\nThis move opened a new course in the artist\u2019s work. Guerrero painted his last figurative work, a self-portrait, in 1950. Thereafter, galvanized by Abstract Expressionism, he abandoned his figurative style for abstraction. Characteristic of this new phase, simplified, biomorphic forms float in a quasi-monochromatic background. By the mid-1950s Guerrero\u2019s style had become more gestural, expressing a deeper sense of urgency, as he loosened his brushstroke and introduced a controlled dripping technique. A selection of these new paintings appeared in an exhibition at Betty Parsons Gallery, New York, in 1954, marking Guerrero\u2019s emergence as a distinctive painter within the New York school. Since moving to New York, Guerrero had become acquainted with some of the most prominent members of the American avant-garde including Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, Mark Rothko, and Theodoros Stamos. Concurrently he met James Johnson Sweeney, critic and director of the Guggenheim Museum, who included his work in Younger American Painters: A Selection (1954).\nIn 1965 Guerrero returned to Spain and from then on divided his time between his native country and the United States. Coinciding with Guerrero\u2019s return to Spain is the reintegration of purer colors in his works, distant from the anxiety-ridden, predominantly black paintings of the late 1950s. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Guerrero\u2019s abstract style continued to evolve, as he created orderly and rhythmic vertical compositions, followed by increasingly dynamic works in which brilliant hues took the lead.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Granada", "artistBirthDate": "1914", "artistDeathDate": "1991"}}, "171": {"paintingDate": "2006", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2011.65_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He received a BFA from the University of Colorado, Boulder (1990), and an MFA from the University of California, Berkeley (1995). In his paintings and works on paper, Grotjahn collapses the seemingly opposed painterly modalities of abstraction and figuration into a singular and visually dynamic artistic gesture. At once formally taut and emotionally charged, his works condense a range of art-historical influences, creating an instantly recognizable oeuvre.\nWhile traditionally abstraction is thought of as a reductive strategy, intended to strip painting of its illusionistic quality in order to emphasize the picture plane itself, for Grotjahn the investigation into the phenomenology of painting is anything but restrained. Indeed, the artist invokes a brash Expressionism to expose the perspectival idiosyncrasies of two-dimensional space. This bravado can be seen clearly in his two best-known bodies of work, his Butterfly paintings (1997\u2013\u00a0) and Face series (2009\u2013\u00a0). In each case Grotjahn continually iterates a fixed motif in order to mount a sustained investigation of widely-held ideas of symmetry, perspective, form, and, ultimately, authorship. Growing out of a body of work loosely known as perspective drawings, Grotjahn\u2019s Butterfly works employ the motif of the radiant band to explore the notion of Renaissance perspective. Seemingly splayed open like the wings of a butterfly, these canvases contain two or more vanishing points set along a vertical band. The rays that emanate from these points are colored in neatly, yet the viewer is never oriented within the canvas. The Face paintings, on the other hand, do not betray such a systematic approach but rather point to the artist\u2019s process. Loose and gestural in appearance, these paintings are composed of sinewy ropes of impasto laid on top of cardboard mounted on linen. In each, a primitively rendered face anchors the canvas, referencing Pablo Picasso\u2019s investigation of perspective in the years leading to his iconic Les demoiselles d\u2019Avignon (1907). \nPicasso\u2019s influence also underlies Grotjahn\u2019s Mask series (2012\u2013\u00a0). These bronze sculptures, which recall anthropological artifacts, are cast from cardboard models and then painted by Grotjahn with his fingers in a seemingly haphazard fashion. Although these works represent his first public foray into three dimensions, Grotjahn has in fact been making the cardboard models that provide the armature of these masks for many years. As in many of his paintings, the artist\u2019s name is embedded within the surface of several sculptures, bringing to the fore an assertion of authorship as a complicating factor. By insisting on the use of an immediately identifiable style as an ersatz signature and simultaneously submerging his literal signature within many of his works, Grotjahn problematizes the slipperiness of the authorial gesture in contemporary art. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Pasadena", "artistBirthDate": "1968", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "170": {"paintingDate": "1917", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/38.238_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

His friends in Paris included Georges Braque, Fernand L\u00e9ger, and Pablo Picasso and the writers Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, and Maurice Raynal. Although he continued to submit humorous illustrations to journals such as L'Assiette au beurre, Le Charivari, and Le Cri de Paris, Gris began to paint seriously in 1910. By 1912 he had developed a personal Cubist style.\nHe exhibited for the first time in 1912 at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in Paris, Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, Der Sturm gallery in Berlin, the Salon de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Normande de Peinture Moderne in Rouen, and the Salon de la Section d'Or in Paris. That same year D.H. Kahnweiler signed Gris to a contract that gave Kahnweiler exclusive rights to the artist's work. Gris became a good friend of Henri Matisse in 1914 and over the next several years formed close relationships with Jacques Lipchitz and Jean Metzinger.

He painted while working as an architectural draftsman in the early 1920s. H\u00e9lion attracted the attention of the collector Georges Bine in 1925 and was soon able to devote himself entirely to painting. In 1927 he met Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda, who collaborated on L'Acte, a short-lived magazine founded by H\u00e9lion and others.\nH\u00e9lion first exhibited at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1928. Shortly thereafter he became acquainted with Jean Arp, Piet Mondrian, and Antoine Pevsner. By 1929 his work was nonfigurative. With Theo van Doesburg and others in 1930 he formed the artists' association Art Concret and the periodical of the same name. This group was succeeded by Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation the next year. In 1931, after traveling through Europe and the Soviet Union, H\u00e9lion returned to Paris, where he met Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, and Tristan Tzara. His first solo show was held at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1932.

After moving to Britain in 1974, she studied at London\u2019s Chelsea School of Art (now Chelsea College of Art and Design, 1976\u201379) and was a Junior Fellow at Cardiff College of Art, Wales (1979\u201380). Houshiary emerged with the New British Sculpture movement artists in the 1980s, alongside Tony Cragg, Richard Deacon, and Anish Kapoor. Though initially working in sculpture, in 1992 she transitioned to making two-dimensional works on canvas as she shifted away from working with defined form in an effort to capture the intangible and formless. \nHoushiary\u2019s three-dimensional works implement Islamic decorative motifs and maintain a minimalist geometry. As part of her project to create a spiritual embodiment of the breath, which she considers to be the fundamental essence of human existence, her move to two-dimensional work marked a further plunge into the elimination of structure. Works such as Touch (1999) and Presence (2006\u201307) comprise amassed marks on a white or black acrylic ground. Drawn from Sufi doctrine and the work of the 13th-century Persian mystic poet Rumi, sacred words are written in Arabic script, minutely repeated and deliberately rendered unintelligible and abstract to produce intricate patterns in graphite and pigment. Houshiary\u2019s consistent use of the white or black field represents a preoccupation with the infinite; while white expresses the absence of boundary, black collapses into itself as with the experience of falling infinitely. Houshiary\u2019s use of word and text is a common denominator within her oeuvre, though their representation constantly evolves. Breath (2003), Houshiary\u2019s first video project, involves a four-screen digital animation with each monitor presenting an expanding and contrasting mist as cultural and religious invocations are recited. The mist is a visualization of the breath, while the soundtrack of Buddhist liturgical music and quotations from the 12th-century German nun Hildegard von Bingen unify into an abstract meditation. Here, the word acts as the formal manifestation of breath, as if misting the screen in an asymmetric, rhythmic movement that is undeniably respiratory in nature. Breath presents the stripped-down representation of an existence that is neither named nor categorized, but simply human.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Shiraz", "artistBirthDate": "1955", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "184": {"paintingDate": "1940", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/92.4044_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He studied art at Southern Methodist University, Dallas, and, after moving to New York in 1926, took night classes at the Art Students League. Like many other Abstract Expressionists, Brooks painted murals for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) Federal Art Project in the late 1930s and early 1940s. His best-known project was a mural titled Flight (1940\u201342) at the International Marine Terminal building at LaGuardia Airport. This vibrant, monumental work\u2014the largest of the WPA murals\u2014measures 12 feet high and 237 feet long and depicts the history of flying, from early mythology to the latest innovations, in a clean, Social Realist style. \nFrom 1942 to 1945, Brooks served as a combat artist with the U.S. Army in the Middle East and returned to New York in 1946, at the height of what would later be termed the Abstract Expressionist movement. An inveterate risk taker, he soon abandoned figuration for abstraction. He reconnected with Jackson Pollock, a friend from the WPA days. Brooks not only took over their Eighth Street studio when Pollock and his wife, artist Lee Krasner, moved to Long Island, but also credited Pollock with encouraging him to try a more gestural style. \nDuring the late 1940s, Brooks's aesthetic evolved from a loose derivation of Cubism to a  moodier, more atmospheric style. In the summer of 1947, Brooks had a breakthrough. He was painting on paper, and glued the paper onto heavy cloth for archival purposes. He noticed that the paste he used to attach the paper to the cloth bled through to the side he was painting on. From then on he would start by working on the cloth and then switch to the front of the painting, combining accidents with deliberate choices in an approach that he used for several years. In the 1960s, Brooks shifted styles again, building compositions out of larger, bolder, and simpler forms.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "St. Louis", "artistBirthDate": "1906", "artistDeathDate": "1992"}}, "63": {"paintingDate": "1999\u20132000", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2000.66_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

A year later she relocated to New York, distancing herself from a London art scene dominated by the new media\u2013oriented Young British Artists. Influenced by Analytic Cubism and Abstract Expressionism as well as academic painting, Brown explores the material and sensual possibilities of oil paint. In exploring issues of sexuality in painting from a feminine perspective, her work often amplifies the eroticism frequently noted in modernist painting, especially Abstract Expressionism, and satirizes the notions of virility often attributed to such work. \nEarly in her career, Brown experimented with other media, most notably animation. Soon after her return to New York, she created the short mixed-media animated film Four Letter Heaven, which premiered at the 1995 Telluride Film Festival. With its humor, sexual imagery, and energetic brushwork, the film introduced themes that would prove prominent in Brown\u2019s later work. The artist soon returned to painting with a series of orgiastic, exuberantly expressionistic images of bunnies. Cartoonish figures and a colorful palette add an element of black comedy to the bacchanalian subject matter, whose imagery recalls both old-master painting and contemporary pornography. In the late 1990s, Brown shifted focus to the human figure and delved deeper into abstraction. In her work from this period, such as On the Town (1998) and The Pyjama Game (1998), bodies and body parts emerge from frenzied brushwork and dissolve into one another. The paintings\u2019 overall eroticism is emphasized by the heavily layered, virtuosic application of paint that draws attention to its sensuous materiality and the pleasure that can be had from looking at art\u2014and at bodies. Placing the viewer at a slight remove from the reality of the paint, their slick, varnished surfaces both highlight the works\u2019 artifice and underscore the voyeurism inherent in viewing. The densely layered brushwork and fragmented imagery overstimulate while signaling Brown\u2019s interest in spectacle. The titles, which are drawn from Hollywood musicals, evoke the pop-cultural predilection for opulent visuals. Brown\u2019s more recent work continues to explore sensuality and spectacle, but in a more sublimated and abstract way. Paintings such as Tender is the Night (1999) or Skulldiver IV (2006\u201307), with only hints of limbs and faces emerging from the tangle of brushstrokes, examine the tension between abstraction and figuration while others, such as The Green, Green Grass of Home (2010), approach complete abstraction. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "London", "artistBirthDate": "1969", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "322": {"paintingDate": "1964", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2012.78_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

During the early 1860s his friendships with Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Degas began. The three paintings Manet sent to the Salon of 1863, including Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019herbe, were relegated to the Salon des Refus\u00e9s, where they attracted the attention of the critic Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9.\nIn 1865 Manet\u2019s Olympia and Christ Mocked were greeted with great hostility when shown at the Salon. That year the painter traveled to Spain, where he met Th\u00e9odore Duret. He became a friend of Emile Zola in 1866, when the writer defended him in a controversial article for the periodical L\u2019Ev\u00e8nement. In 1867 Zola published a longer article on Manet, who that year exhibited his work in an independent pavilion at the Paris World\u2019s Fair. The artist spent the first of several summers in Boulogne at this time. In 1868 two of his works were accepted by the Salon but were not shown to advantage.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Paris", "artistBirthDate": "1832", "artistDeathDate": "1883"}}, "326": {"paintingDate": "1960", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2012.80_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He made the first of several visits to Pontoise in 1872; there, he worked alongside Pissarro. He participated in the first Impressionist exhibition of 1874. From 1876 to 1879 his works were again rejected by the Salon. C\u00e9zanne showed again with the Impressionists in 1877 in their third exhibition. At that time, Georges Rivi\u00e8re was one of the few critics to support his art. In 1882 the Salon accepted his work for the first and only time. Beginning in 1883 C\u00e9zanne resided in the South of France, returning to Paris occasionally.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Aix-en-Provence", "artistBirthDate": "1839", "artistDeathDate": "1906"}}, "79": {"paintingDate": "1911\u201312", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/49.1211_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Accardi quickly became part of the inner circle of the Art Club and was a frequent visitor to Pietro Consagra's studio. There she met the artists with whom she would establish the influential postwar group Forma 1 (Form 1, 1947\u201351): Consagra, Piero Dorazio, Mino Guerrini, Achille Perilli, Antonio Sanfilippo (whom she would marry), and Giulio Turcato. The group\u2019s manifesto, which Accardi signed in 1947, called for reconciling Marxist politics with abstract art. The group\u2019s first exhibition occurred in Rome in 1947, and Accardi's first solo show soon followed, in 1950 at the Galleria Age d\u2019or, Rome. Her early paintings consisted of interlocking geometric forms. \n In the 1950s, Accardi was involved in the wide-reaching attempts to revolutionize abstraction through the hybridization of geometric abstraction and gestural painting, both in Italy, where she appeared in Arte astratta e concreta in Italia\u20141951 (Abstract and concrete art in Italy\u20141951) at the Galleria nazionale d\u2019arte moderna, Rome, and in France, where art critic Michel Tapi\u00e9 took an interest in her work. (Tapi\u00e9 would later write the introduction to the catalogue accompanying Accardi's 1959 solo exhibition at the Galleria Notizie in Turin.) After forswearing painting from 1952 to 1953, Accardi began to introduce pseudo-calligraphic signs into abstract images, as in Labirinto a settori (Labyrinths and fields, 1957), while reducing her palette to white-on-black compositions to explore the relationship between figure and ground. \nIn 1961 Accardi reintegrated color and began painting on sicofoil, a transparent plastic, instead of canvas. She showcased these new strategies at the 1964 Venice Biennale. By the mid-1960s, she was using these new materials sculpturally. Tenda (Tent, 1965) and Triplice Tenda (Triple tent, 1969) feature sheets of plastic assembled into a tent and covered with brightly colored brushstroke patterns. This phase of Accardi's oeuvre, which was celebrated in the Ambiente/Arte section of the 1976 Venice Biennale, would prove influential for Arte Povera. In the 1980s she returned to canvas and shifted her focus to the use of signs and chromatic juxtapositions.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Trapani", "artistBirthDate": "1924", "artistDeathDate": "2014"}}, "542": {"paintingDate": "1961", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2012.98_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

After experimenting with film from 1981 to 1985, Tuymans returned to painting. Modeled from found photographs and media images, his paintings examine moments of individual and collective trauma obliquely by focusing on the unremarkableness of source images that both belie their sinister nature and signal the limits of representation. Influenced by his work in film, he tightly crops his images and subjects them to several layers of mediation, typically rephotographing and drawing them before rendering the final work in oil in a single day. Representations of representations, the resulting blurred, bleached paintings, which Tuymans has dubbed \u201cauthentic forgeries,\u201d draw attention to the distortions and occlusions of historical memory.\u00b9 \nThe Holocaust is an important theme in Tuymans\u2019s early work. In Gas Chamber (1986), the horrific purpose of the bare, windowless room lightly sketched in stained, sepia browns is only revealed through the work\u2019s title. By refusing to dramatize a traumatic chapter in European history, the painting instead emphasizes both the banality of evil and the treacherous nature of representation. Belgian colonialism is another significant subject, and while representing Belgium at the 2001 Venice Biennale, he incited scandal by exhibiting a series of paintings on the 1961 assassination of Congolese prime minister Patrice Lumumba. The works range from representations of iconic images of Lumumba and the Belgian king Baudouin I to those with further layers of mediation. Reconstruction (2000), based on a documentary reenactment of Lumumba\u2019s murder, collapses several layers of representation. The source image is itself a fabrication, a reconstruction of an event that was not photographically documented, and Tuymans\u2019s re-presentation of it as a painting obscures the constructed nature of the source and confuses his work\u2019s relationship to historical reality. In more recent works, Tuymans has explored American culture and politics. For Documenta, Kassel, Germany (2002), and in response to the attacks of September 11, he produced an immense yet characteristically bland still life, highlighting art\u2019s inability to address violence of such magnitude. Later series delve into the dark side of Americana, corporate culture, and the utopianism of Walt Disney.\nCo-organized by the Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus (2009\u201310), and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2010), a retrospective of Tuymans\u2019s work traveled to the Dallas Museum of Art (2010); Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (2010\u201311); and Palais des beaux-arts, Brussels (2011). A European retrospective appeared at the M\u0171csarnok Kunsthalle, Budapest (2007\u201308); Haus der Kunst, Munich (2008); and Zach\u0119ta Narodowa Galeria Sztuki, Warsaw (2008).

His family immigrated to the United States in 1913. Living in New York\u2019s Lower East Side, Tworkov worked hard to learn English. He attended Columbia University to study literature and become a writer. His sister, meanwhile, became an artist and introduced Tworkov to the New York art scene. She encouraged him to visit the creative community thriving in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a town he would visit throughout his life. Also around this time, Tworkov first saw the work of Paul C\u00e9zanne and Henri Matisse, which inspired him to leave Columbia and pursue a painting career. He studied at the National Academy of Design (1923) and then at the Art Students League (1925\u201326). Along with this formal training, he absorbed the dominant trends in European art and was especially influenced by Vasily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, and Joan Mir\u00f3.\nTworkov\u2019s early work owes much to C\u00e9zanne. Applying paint in large blocks that flaunt the flatness of the picture plane, his paintings cohered into still lifes, landscapes, and narrative scenes. During the Great Depression, Tworkov\u2019s subject matter took on social issues. He was employed in the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project easel division from 1934 to 1941. After World War II, Tworkov met Willem de Kooning, whose emotive and gestural style inspired him. He became part of the community of emerging Abstract Expressionists who in 1949 founded the Club, a group of avant-garde artists who gathered in Greenwich Village to discuss and debate art. They organized lectures, concerts, and performances and held regular roundtable discussions to rethink the relationship of art to politics and urban life. In this context Tworkov\u2019s compositions reached their most chaotic and irregular. Yet even in these works, he applied the paint so thickly that despite their haphazard appearance, the brushstrokes produced solid blocks of color reminiscent of his earlier paintings. This predilection for more orderly compositions eventually caused Tworkov to distance himself from De Kooning and Abstract Expressionism in the late 1950s. Indeed, throughout his career, he remained torn between gestural and geometric abstraction. Tworkov eventually resolved this conflict by adopting a disciplined abstraction that combined irregular brushstrokes, ruler-drawn lines, and gridded patterns.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Biala Podlaska", "artistBirthDate": "1900", "artistDeathDate": "1982"}}, "545": {"paintingDate": "1918", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/54.1360_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In 1922 he completed his law degree but soon after devoted himself entirely to painting and joined Felice Carena's atelier. Between 1927 and 1931, Capogrossi traveled frequently to Paris, and along with Corrado Cagli and Emanuele Cavalli worked in a figurative style characterized by pale and ethereal tones, which endowed their compositions with a mysterious, almost magical aura. The three artists were among the loose association of painters that came to be known as Scuola Romana (Roman School). In 1933 they collaborated on the \"Manifesto del primordialismo plastico\" (Manifesto of plastic primordialism), in which they discussed the presence of the archaic in the contemporary world. From the mid-1930s, Capogrossi adopted a darker palette, and between 1945 and 1948 his figurative tonal painting gave way to an increasingly abstract geometric style. \nA decisive shift in Capogrossi's career took place in 1949, when he developed a vocabulary of irregular comb- or fork-shaped signs. With no allegorical, psychological, or symbolic meanings, these structural elements could be assembled and connected in countless variations. Intricate and insistent, Capogrossi's signs determined the construction of the pictorial surface. Similar to mysterious lists or sequences, his paintings were immediate in their appeal yet remained hard to decode, a quality he shared with Art Informel practitioners. These abstract comb-sign paintings, usually known simply as Surfaces (Superficies), were begun in 1949 and first exhibited at the Galleria del secolo, Rome, in 1950. Soon becoming the hallmark of Capogrossi's style, the comb sign dominated his oeuvre until the end of his career. \nIn 1951, Capogrossi joined Mario Ballocco, Alberto Burri, and Ettore Colla in showing work at Aurora 41, Rome, an occasion that marked the debut of the group Origine (Origin, 1950\u201351). Primarily concerned with the promotion of abstract art, the group reacted against mainstream realist practices and advocated a simplified language meant to return art to its origins. The following year, Capogrossi joined the Movimento spaziale (Spatial movement, 1947\u201360), initiated by Lucio Fontana in Milan. Readily embracing the many changes affecting the country in the postwar era, especially scientific progress, the group advocated for a new spatial art that acknowledged recent inventions such as television and neon lighting.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Rome", "artistBirthDate": "1900", "artistDeathDate": "1972"}}, "120": {"paintingDate": "1959", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/74.2078_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

His dramatic and fascinating life story\u2014which he recalled in his memoir, A Not So Still Life  (1984)\u2014nearly overshadows his art. He was the son of Surrealist painter Max Ernst and Jewish art historian and journalist Louise Straus. After his parents divorced in 1922 and his father moved to Paris, Ernst remained in Cologne with his mother. During trips to visit his father, however, Ernst met other celebrated Surrealists, including Luis Buuel, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Man Ray, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Joan Mir\u00f3, and Yves Tanguy. Five years after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933, Ernst immigrated to the United States, where he found work in the film library at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York, and in 1942, became director of Peggy Guggenheim's gallery-museum Art of This Century.\nIn New York, Ernst cultivated the painting career he had begun in Europe (he had decided to pursue painting after seeing Pablo Picasso's Guernica at the 1937 Paris World's Fair). His first solo exhibition was in 1943 at the Norlyst Gallery. While living in the United States, Ernst petitioned the Emergency Rescue Committee to help his parents escape France (Straus had moved to Paris in 1933). It successfully secured Max Ernst's immigration in 1941, but Straus remained in France and was held in a detention camp near Paris before being sent to the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz in 1944, unbeknownst to her son. She did not survive the war.\nErnst's early work was explicitly surreal, resembling his father's, and he often built on a foundation produced by Surrealist automatism. Many of these paintings bear distinctly biomorphic and occasionally figurative forms. However, Ernst soon turned to Abstract Expressionism, working in a linear and geometric style. In 1950 he joined the artists who were later dubbed the Irascibles in protest of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's resistance to showing abstraction in a juried exhibition. Yet in the 1960s and 1970s Ernst returned to figuration, producing paintings that often incorporate Native American symbols, perhaps inspired by the art that he saw while living in Sedona, Arizona. Toward the end of his life he painted landscapes that echo the linear precision of his early abstract work.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Cologne", "artistBirthDate": "1920", "artistDeathDate": "1984"}}, "127": {"paintingDate": "1919", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/48.1172.280_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In 1911 Ernst became a friend of August Macke and joined the Rheinische Expressionisten group in Bonn. Ernst showed for the first time in 1912 at the Galerie Feldman in Cologne. At the Sonderbund exhibition of that year in Cologne he saw the work of Paul C\u00e9zanne, Edvard Munch, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh. In 1913 he met Guillaume Apollinaire and Robert Delaunay and traveled to Paris. Ernst participated that same year in the Erste deutsche Herbstsalon. In 1914 he met Jean Arp, who was to become a lifelong friend.\nDespite military service throughout World War I, Ernst was able to continue painting and to exhibit in Berlin at Der Sturm in 1916. He returned to Cologne in 1918. The next year he produced his first collages and founded the short-lived Cologne Dada movement with Johannes Theodor Baargeld; they were joined by Arp and others.

In 1922 he completed his law degree but soon after devoted himself entirely to painting and joined Felice Carena's atelier. Between 1927 and 1931, Capogrossi traveled frequently to Paris, and along with Corrado Cagli and Emanuele Cavalli worked in a figurative style characterized by pale and ethereal tones, which endowed their compositions with a mysterious, almost magical aura. The three artists were among the loose association of painters that came to be known as Scuola Romana (Roman School). In 1933 they collaborated on the \"Manifesto del primordialismo plastico\" (Manifesto of plastic primordialism), in which they discussed the presence of the archaic in the contemporary world. From the mid-1930s, Capogrossi adopted a darker palette, and between 1945 and 1948 his figurative tonal painting gave way to an increasingly abstract geometric style. \nA decisive shift in Capogrossi's career took place in 1949, when he developed a vocabulary of irregular comb- or fork-shaped signs. With no allegorical, psychological, or symbolic meanings, these structural elements could be assembled and connected in countless variations. Intricate and insistent, Capogrossi's signs determined the construction of the pictorial surface. Similar to mysterious lists or sequences, his paintings were immediate in their appeal yet remained hard to decode, a quality he shared with Art Informel practitioners. These abstract comb-sign paintings, usually known simply as Surfaces (Superficies), were begun in 1949 and first exhibited at the Galleria del secolo, Rome, in 1950. Soon becoming the hallmark of Capogrossi's style, the comb sign dominated his oeuvre until the end of his career. \nIn 1951, Capogrossi joined Mario Ballocco, Alberto Burri, and Ettore Colla in showing work at Aurora 41, Rome, an occasion that marked the debut of the group Origine (Origin, 1950\u201351). Primarily concerned with the promotion of abstract art, the group reacted against mainstream realist practices and advocated a simplified language meant to return art to its origins. The following year, Capogrossi joined the Movimento spaziale (Spatial movement, 1947\u201360), initiated by Lucio Fontana in Milan. Readily embracing the many changes affecting the country in the postwar era, especially scientific progress, the group advocated for a new spatial art that acknowledged recent inventions such as television and neon lighting.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Rome", "artistBirthDate": "1900", "artistDeathDate": "1972"}}, "414": {"paintingDate": "1920", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/76.2553.24_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

When he was just ten years old, a portrait painter created a pastel depicting him with his sister, making a great impression on him and instilling a strong interest in drawing and painting. Palazuelo began studying architecture in Madrid in 1932 and later at the School of Arts and Crafts, Oxford, England (1934\u201336). While there he became familiar with the Tecton group of architects (1932\u201348) and the work of artists such as Jacob Epstein and Duncan Grant. He took the Intermediate Exams of the Royal Institute of British Architects before the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, and he returned to serve as a pilot in the Spanish army.\nPalazuelo decided not to return to England and began to devote much time to painting, exhibiting at the Galer\u00eda Buchholz, Madrid, in 1945 alongside members of the young Madrid School. In 1946 or 1947 he became enamored with Paul Klee\u2019s work, specifically his interest in geometry and abstract geometric forms found in nature. Juan Gris, Pablo Picasso, and Daniel V\u00e1zquez D\u00edaz, who was Palazuelo\u2019s painting instructor in the late 1940s, also influenced his early abstracted still lifes. However, by 1948, Palazuelo had eliminated all figuration in his paintings, pursuing purely abstract forms. He exhibited his first abstract work in the inaugural Salon de Mai, Paris, in 1949. In 1948, aided by a French government grant, he had moved to Paris, where he would remain until 1969, coming into contact with artists associated with Galerie Maeght, where he had his first solo exhibition in 1955 and continued to exhibit until the 1980s. His 1950s work delved deeper into abstract form, as he explored Arabic and Eastern thought, particularly the musical rhythms of Islamic art, infinity, and the notion of the \u201cactive imagination.\u201d In 1953\u201354, he participated in Younger European Painters: A Selection at the Guggenheim Museum.\nBetween 1954, with his first sculpture in melted bronze, Ascendant, and 1962, he gradually began creating work in three dimensions, and in the 1970s working specifically with open and closed polygonal shapes. In 1969 he returned to Spain and settled in his family\u2019s home close to San Lorenzo de El Escorial. He developed his foundational themes of inner conscience, imagination, and transmutation in public works such as Lauda II for Madrid\u2019s Barajas Airport, and his mural for the foyer of the Picasso Tower, Madrid, in 1990.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Madrid", "artistBirthDate": "1916", "artistDeathDate": "2007"}}, "416": {"paintingDate": "2004", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2005.13_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

At a young age he wanted to become a painter, although his father, a successful industrialist, urged him to pursue a more practical career. In 1922 he enrolled at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, but just two years later his fascination with Western art movements led him to Paris, where he briefly studied with the Japanese artist Foujita Tsuguharu (L\u00e9onard Foujita) and exhibited in the 1927 Salon d'Automne. On Okada's return to Japan that year, his work received favorable critical response, resulting in his first solo exhibition at the Galerie Nichido, Tokyo, in 1929, where he continued to exhibit until 1935. In 1936 the group Nika-kai (Second-Section Society), the largest association of Japanese contemporary artists, awarded him a prestigious prize. He also had a number of teaching posts in Japanese universities, including the School of Fine Arts, Nippon University; Musashino Art Institute; and the Tama Fine Arts College, all Tokyo.\nOkada continued to paint in a Western figurative tradition, particularly impressionistic landscapes, for the next 20 years while in Japan. After World WarII, however, Okada felt dissatisfied with the Japanese contemporary art scene and left for New York in 1950. There he met Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still, as well as other artists associated with what would later become known as Abstract Expressionism. His geographical move also marked a decisive shift toward abstraction, although he never entirely abandoned figuration. For Okada the binary opposition between figuration and abstraction was irrelevant, a product of a Western mind-set, yet he insisted that Abstract Expressionism's emphasis on the subconscious became a conduit for his exploration of his cultural heritage.\nSpecific elements of Japanese culture, such as 17th-century screen painting, Zen Buddhism, and ancient No theater, are prominent in his postwar paintings. The influence of nature can be seen in his delicate and subdued palette, as in the earth tones of Decision (1956), as well as in his process. He often used natural materials such as rocks and sticks to help visualize and structure his compositions. In the 1960s critics drew comparisons between his allover paintings and the work of Color Field artists such as Helen Frankenthaler and Jules Olitski.

Shortly after entering the oil painting department of the Tokyo Fine Arts School in 1929, Okamoto accompanied his parents on a trip to Europe. He remained there, living in Paris for the next ten years. Inspired by Pablo Picasso\u2019s work, Okamoto started to pursue abstract art, and from 1933 to 1937, he was a member of the group Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation. In 1938, Okamoto began studying ethnology, with a focus on Oceania, under the tutelage of Marcel Mauss at the Sorbonne. His ethnological interests extended throughout his career, both inspiring his artistic practice and leading to a prolific collection of writings on the subject. During his time in Paris, Okamoto also associated with the intellectual Georges Bataille as well as Surrealism founder Andr\u00e9 Breton and Swiss Surrealist Kurt Seligman. \nFollowing the German invasion of France, Okamoto returned to Japan in 1940. In 1941 the 28th Nika exhibition, held by Nika-kai (Second-Section Society), a group of anti-mainstream Japanese artists that Okamoto later joined, included a number of his works made while he was living in Europe; he was subsequently awarded the Nika Prize. While in Paris, Okamoto had worked in both abstract and Surrealist styles, but he came to believe the two movements were incompatible. In 1947, in response to this conflict, he introduced as the core of his artistic principle Taikyoku-ism (polarism), an idea that proposed the communion of opposites. Based on these tenets, he created works such as Dawn (1948), Heavy Industry (1949), and Law of the Jungle (1950). The following year, he established the Yoru-no-kai (Night Society) with critic Kiyoteru Hanada as a means to integrate avant-garde art and literature. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Okamoto focused on executing public projects, including installations in subway stations and government buildings in Japan. He painted a monumental mural for a hotel in Mexico entitled Tomorrow\u2019s Mythology (1968), a work that depicts a human figure being hit by an atomic bomb. In 1961, Okamoto withdrew from Nika-kai and other art circles with which he had associated. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Tokyo", "artistBirthDate": "1911", "artistDeathDate": "1996"}}, "412": {"paintingDate": "1970", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/86.3484_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

The government executed his father, a commissar, only a few months before his birth. In 1923 he immigrated with his mother and grandmother to Brooklyn, New York, where his mother married Hyman Olitsky, whose name the artist eventually took (the \"y\" became an \"i\" in 1958, after it was misspelled on a public announcement). Olitski was deeply affected by an early experience of viewing the portraits of the Dutch old master painter Rembrandt van Rijn at the New York World's Fair in 1939, an event that solidified his artistic calling and strongly influenced his early style. He studied under Sidney Dickinson at the National Academy of Design in New York from 1939 to 1942, while simultaneously taking sculpture courses at the nearby Beaux Arts Institute of Design from 1940 to 1942. During this time he discovered abstract art at the Museum of Non-Objective Painting, an early incarnation of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum.\nAfter serving in the army from 1942 to 1945, he continued his artistic education in Paris under the G. I. Bill, studying at the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re and Ossip Zadkine's studio between the years of 1949 and 1951. It was in Paris at the Galerie Huit in 1951 that Olitski held his first solo show. In the ten years following his return to the United States in 1951, Olitski experimented with thick impasto in the manner of Jean Dubuffet and Jean Fautrier, until he settled upon a method that came to be characterized as Color Field painting, an offshoot of Abstract Expressionism for which he is now known. Like other artists working in this mode, such as Kenneth Noland or Morris Louis, Olitski stained the canvas with paint, allowing the color to soak into its fibers. At first, Olitski poured paint directly onto the canvas or applied it with rollers, brushes, or sponges, but after a suggestion by Noland, he finally settled on using a spray gun to saturate the surface with a thin layer of liquid paint. In this way he was not confined to a monochrome field limited in color and density. In addition, the spray-application process allowed for a certain level of accidental dripping and splattering that disrupts the surface of the works, preventing them from taking on a highly polished, commercialized finish.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Snovsk", "artistBirthDate": "1922", "artistDeathDate": "2007"}}, "413": {"paintingDate": "2013", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2014.44_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Since that time, he has traveled extensively and has lived in Berlin, Mexico City, and New York.\nOrozco works in media including drawing, installation, photography, sculpture, and video. His aesthetic vocabulary is indebted to Conceptualism, the artistic traditions of his native Mexico, and Marcel Duchamp\u2019s readymades. The fragile relationship of everyday objects to one another and to human beings is Orozco\u2019s principal subject. In his early work, he placed such items in unexpected locations, documenting their presence in photographs. Five Problems (1992), for example, depicts five potatoes sitting on five stacks of spiral notebooks in the stationery section of a store. Throughout the 1990s, Orozco continued to use found everyday objects in his sculptures, as is apparent in Yogurt Caps (1994), a series of clear plastic yogurt lids with colored edges, and Toilet Ventilator (1997), an installation that includes rolls of toilet paper attached to the blades of a ceiling fan, each progressively unraveling as the ventilator turns.\nAnimals, insects, and the human body are often the subjects of Orozco\u2019s work.

He was enrolled at the Ecole des Arts D\u00e9coratifs in Paris from 1895 to 1897 and later studied with Fernand Cormon, Ferdinand Humbert, and Albert Charles Wallet. He began to paint in an Impressionist manner in the winter of 1902\u201303 and started to exhibit works in this style at the Salon d\u2019Automne and the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants of 1903. His first solo show was held at the Galerie Haussmann, Paris, in 1905. From 1908, elements of Fauvism and Neo-Impressionism as well as Cubism and other forms of abstraction appeared in his painting, and by 1912 he had evolved a personal amalgam of Cubism and Fauvism. Picabia worked in an abstract mode from this period until the early 1920s.\nPicabia became a friend of Guillaume Apollinaire and Marcel Duchamp and associated with the Puteaux group in 1911 and 1912. He participated in the 1913 Armory Show, visiting New York on this occasion and frequenting avant-garde circles. Alfred Stieglitz gave him a solo exhibition at his gallery \u201c291\u201d that same year. In 1915, which marked the beginning of Picabia\u2019s machinist or mechanomorphic period, he and Duchamp, among others, instigated and participated in Dada manifestations in New York. Picabia lived in Barcelona in 1916 and 1917. In 1917, he published his first volume of poetry and the first issues of 391, his magazine modeled after Stieglitz\u2019s periodical 291.

After he left Couture\u2019s studio, Manet traveled extensively in Europe, visiting Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Italy. In 1859 he was rejected by the official Paris Salon, although Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix intervened on his behalf. In 1861 Manet\u2019s paintings were accepted by the Salon and received favorable press, and he began exhibiting at the Galerie Martinet in Paris. During the early 1860s his friendships with Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Degas began. The three paintings Manet sent to the Salon of 1863, including Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019herbe, were relegated to the Salon des Refus\u00e9s, where they attracted the attention of the critic Th\u00e9ophile Thor\u00e9.\nIn 1865 Manet\u2019s Olympia and Christ Mocked were greeted with great hostility when shown at the Salon. That year the painter traveled to Spain, where he met Th\u00e9odore Duret. He became a friend of Emile Zola in 1866, when the writer defended him in a controversial article for the periodical L\u2019Ev\u00e8nement. In 1867 Zola published a longer article on Manet, who that year exhibited his work in an independent pavilion at the Paris World\u2019s Fair.

Finding inspiration in the natural surroundings of his native region, Manessier began to paint landscapes at an early age. For his formal education, he studied architecture, first in Amiens and then as an architecture student at the \u00c9cole des beaux-arts, Paris, in 1929. Manessier disliked the school\u2019s formal atmosphere and preferred to copy paintings at the Louvre\u2014particularly those by old masters such as Rembrandt van Rijn, Peter Paul Rubens, and Tintoretto\u2014and frequent the ateliers of Montparnasse. He also briefly studied in 1935 at the Acad\u00e9mie Ranson under Roger Bissi\u00e8re, who introduced Manessier to fresco technique, and leading up to World War II, his paintings began to reflect both Cubist and Surrealist influences. In 1939 Manessier was drafted into military service.\nIn the postwar period, Manessier was associated with Lyrical Abstraction (Abstraction lyrique) and Art Informel. However, his work also adhered to a more specific strand of French art that appeared during the German occupation and incorporated Christian themes and symbolism into semiabstract compositions. The Catholic painter Jean Bazaine, a strong proponent of art sacr\u00e9 (sacred art), included Manessier\u2019s work in the famous Vingt jeunes peintres de tradition fran\u00e7aise (Twenty young painters of the French tradition, 1941) organized at Galerie Braun, Paris, in defiance of the Nazis. In 1943, Manessier experienced a religious awakening during a three-day retreat to a Trappist monastery. Soon after he converted to Roman Catholicism and began to pursue an increasingly ascetic lifestyle. In 1945 his compositions started to recall stained-glass windows and turned more abstract, although figurative elements connected to religion and landscape continued to appear. His paintings allude to religious meanings through their titles and through combinations of discernible symbols and abstract imagery.\nWhile Manessier initially gained international recognition for his paintings, he was fluent in a variety of mediums, including lithography, as well as designs for tapestries, liturgical objects, and vestments. At the urging of Georges Rouault, Manessier began to work on stained glass in 1948 and completed many pieces for churches in France, Germany, Spain, and Switzerland. Beginning in 1956, religious symbolism and political themes coexist in a number of works responding to various political events such as the Suez Crisis, invasion of Hungary, and assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In the 1960s Manessier made several trips to Spain, where he was influenced by the works of El Greco and Francisco de Goya, as well as to Canada, the Netherlands, and the South of France, where the natural landscapes\u2014a persistent theme throughout his oeuvre\u2014influenced the content and style of his work at the time.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "", "artistBirthDate": "", "artistDeathDate": "1993"}}, "313": {"paintingDate": "1918", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/83.3107_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Self-taught, he was an admirer of Renaissance artists Andrea del Castagno, Paolo Uccello, and Piero della Francesca. He was particularly interested in fresco painting, whose influence is apparent in his experimental compositions in collage, painting, and drawing. In 1911 the founder of Futurism, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, invited him to join his artistic and social movement, but Magnelli declined. Although he exhibited with the group, he instead followed the path of abstraction, even while retaining some Futurist elements.\nEarly in his career, Magnelli traveled to Paris to visit fellow artists; in 1914 he bought works by Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Carlo Carr\u00e0, and Alexander Archipenko for his uncle, the collector Alessandro Magnelli. In this period, Magnelli\u2019s work was primarily figurative, as in Man on a Cart (L\u2019Homme \u00e0 la charrette, 1914). The artist\u2019s first abstract works appeared during the winter of 1914\u201315. He made a series of what he called \u201cinvented works,\u201d such as Painting No. 0528 (Peinture No. 0528, 1915), characterized by bright areas of colors and elliptical patterns. In 1916 he started his military training, and upon his release began experimenting with geometric figuration, as seen in the series Lyric Explosion (Explosion lyrique, 1918). These pictures celebrate the end of the war, creatively integrating Fauvist color, the dynamism of Futurism, and the armature of Cubism. After the war, Magnelli traveled to Germany, Switzerland, France, and Austria before eventually settling in Paris in 1930. A trip the following year through the Carrara marble region in Italy inspired the series Stones (Pierres, 1931\u201336): haunting, Surrealistic portrayals of massive marble blocks rendered in simplified lines, an abstracted and heavy plasticity against an otherworldly background.\nDuring World War II, the artist lived in Grasse, France, keeping company with artists Robert Delaunay and Jean Arp. Beginning in 1936, Magnelli created textural geometric collages, such as Cahiers d\u2019Art (ca. 1937), using materials including corrugated cardboard, emery cloth, music paper, stitched wire, and metal plates. He also executed a number of paintings on schoolchildren\u2019s wood-framed slate boards (1937\u201343). Many of these works were luminous geometric compositions constructed from flat areas of color and inscribed white lines (e.g., Untitled [Sans titre, 1937]), while others were inscriptions of purely geometric lines (e.g., Ardoise no. 33 [1937]). During this time, Magnelli also participated in the activities of the Abstraction\u2013Cr\u00e9ation group with Vasily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, and Arp. He returned to Paris in 1944, and soon began making refined geometric works such as Diffuse Light (Lumi\u00e8re diffuse, 1950). In 1959 he moved to Meudon, France, where he died on April 20, 1971.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Florence", "artistBirthDate": "1888", "artistDeathDate": "1971"}}, "312": {"paintingDate": "1962", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/67.1846_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In 1933 Afro started working in a figurative style rich in symbolic accents and pale and ethereal tones, akin to that of the Scuola Romana (Roman School), with which he was temporarily affiliated. Afro moved to Rome in 1938, but served in the Italian army (and participated in the anti-Fascist Resistance) during World War II. He also taught mosaic design at the Accademia di belle arti, Venice, and his work took a new slant, as figuration gradually gave way to a growing interest in Cubism. \nReturning to Rome in 1945, Afro encountered tensions between proponents of abstraction and those who favored realism, but he was only marginally involved in these controversies. By the end of the decade he had developed a strand of abstraction based on intersecting geometric planes and expressive juxtapositions of color and light. Increasingly weary of the polemics among painters in Italy, Afro turned his attention to the American scene. In 1950 he traveled to New York for the opening of a group show of Italian artists at the Catherine Viviano Gallery, a venue that hosted his first U.S. solo exhibition later that year and regular exhibitions of his work through 1968.\nFrom 1952 Afro's painting took a new direction, adding fluid signs, rounded contours, and a brighter palette and replacing the angular forms and quasi-monochromatic pictorial language of earlier years. That same year he joined the Gruppo degli Otto Pittori Italiani (Group of eight Italian painters, 1952\u201354), whose \"abstract-concrete\" leanings represented an alternative to the Italian abstraction-realism polarization. The group exhibited together at the 1952 Venice Biennale, but by 1954 Afro had distanced himself from the Otto\u2014a move that coincided with the introduction of an increasingly dynamic gesture in his works. More dramatic and spontaneous, Afro's late 1950s works testify to his growing interest in Abstract Expressionism, amplified by his friendship with Willem de Kooning, who stayed in Afro's studio in Rome in 1959, and Afro's frequent visits to the United States. James Johnson Sweeney, art critic and former director of the Guggenheim Museum, authored an early monograph on Afro in 1961. Afro's paintings of the 1960s were increasingly gestural, a tendency that he reversed at the end of the decade when his works became more synthetic and geometric. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Udine", "artistBirthDate": "1912", "artistDeathDate": "1976"}}, "368": {"paintingDate": "1927", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/57.1459_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

She received a BA in 1970 from the University of Florida at Gainesville and an MFA in 1972 from Syracuse University, New York. Having studied photography and painting, she employed a photorealistic style in the 1970s to capture banal feminine realities such as kitchen floors and frozen peas; in 1978, she moved to New York. In the 1980s and early 1990s, she turned her exacting style to sensual subjects such as food, the female body, and pornography. A critical backlash against her explicitly sexual work caused Minter to question the origin of the public's discomfort with the body and sexuality, which drew her toward ubiquitous, lascivious\u2014yet not lewd\u2014imagery in popular culture, especially in the fashion world. Minter at first set out to reinvigorate the tropes of fashion photography through fine art, but the juxtaposition of in-your-face beauty with down-and-dirty reality ultimately became her focus. She appropriates the vocabulary of fashion and beauty, then mars the Photoshopped flawlessness and color palette of contemporary advertising with sweat, spit, hair, and dirt. \nThough earlier paintings were modeled after existing photographs, since 1995 Minter has been the genesis of the finished paintings' source images. Featuring meticulous costumes and composed and captured by a 35 mm film camera, the images are never manipulated in postproduction. It is only after Minter decides to make a painting that she combines the images in the photo shoot into a new composition, transforming parted lips, made-up eyes, and flashy accessories into one painted image of beauty and sensuality. Most often enamel on metal, the large-scale works capitalize on her photorealistic technique to critique the promise of perfection in fashion, exposing physical imperfections and the unabashed exploitation of women's bodies as catalysts for consumerism. Using her fingers to soften and model the quick-drying enamel paint, Minter highlights the power and effect of these physical, material, and feminine talismans of beauty. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Shreveport", "artistBirthDate": "1948", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "360": {"paintingDate": "1997", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2001.222_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Milhazes has said, \u201cI love painting, but I do not want the texture of the brushstrokes or the \u2018hand\u2019 of the painter to be visible on my canvases.\u201d\u00b9 Both this love of painting and the consequences of her technique are richly evident in the collaged-on designs, which retain an organic feel in their wildly colorful combination of graceful arabesques, geometric abstraction, and floral patterns. \nMilhazes\u2019s first major museum exhibition was organized in 2001 by Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, England, and traveled later that year to the Birmingham Museum of Art, Alabama. Her work was included in the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial in 2002 and 2004, and in 2003 she represented Brazil at the Venice Biennale. In 2009, the Fondation Cartier pour l\u2019art contemporain, Paris, mounted a large-scale retrospective that included two new, site-specific installations on the building\u2019s exterior glass walls. Milhazes has created several public art projects, including G\u00e1vea (2004) at the Selfridges department store in Manchester, Peace and Love (2005\u201306) at the Gloucester Road tube station in London, Maracolouco (2008) at the Tokyo Museum of Contemporary Art, and Bailinho (2008) at the Pinacoteca do estado de S\u00e3o Paulo.

At the outset of World War II Brauner fled to the South of France, where he maintained contact with other Surrealists in Marseilles. Later he sought refuge in Switzerland; unable to obtain suitable materials there, he improvised an encaustic from candle wax and developed a graffito technique.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Piatra-Neamt", "artistBirthDate": "1903", "artistDeathDate": "1966"}}, "258": {"paintingDate": "1926", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/76.2553.90_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Burri began his career not as an artist but as a doctor, earning a medical degree in 1940 from the Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Perugia and serving as a physician in the Italian army during World War II. Following his unit\u2019s capture in northern Africa, he was interned in a prisoner-of-war camp in Hereford, Texas, in 1944, where he started to paint on the burlap that was readily at hand. After his release in 1946, Burri moved to Rome, where his first solo show was held at the Galleria La Margherita the following year.\nLike many Italian artists of his generation who reacted against the politicized realism popular in the late 1940s, Burri soon turned to abstraction, becoming a proponent of Art Informel. Around 1949\u201350 he experimented with various unorthodox materials, fabricating tactile collages with pumice, tar, and burlap as in his sacchi (sacks), which were initially considered assaults against the aesthetic canon. At this time, he also commenced the muffe (molds) and the gobbo (hunchback) paintings; the latter were humped canvases that broke with the traditional two-dimensional plane. This preoccupation with the ambiguity of the pictorial surface and with non-art materials led Burri to help form the group Origine (Origin, 1950\u201351) in opposition to the increasingly decorative nature of abstraction. The artists in Origine exhibited their work together in 1951 at Aurora 41, Rome.\nIn 1953\u201354, Burri garnered attention in the United States when his work was included in the group exhibition Younger European Painters: A Selection at the Guggenheim Museum and was shown as well at the Frumkin Gallery, Chicago, and Stable Gallery, New York. In the mid-1950s Burri began burning his materials, a technique he termed combustione (combustion). These charred wood and burlap works were first exhibited in 1957 at the Galleria dell\u2019Obelisco, Rome. In 1958 his welded iron sheets were shown at the Galleria Blu, Milan, and in 1960 at Martha Jackson Gallery, New York, the latter show including Grande Ferro M-4 (1959). That same year, Burri was awarded Third Prize at the Carnegie International, Pittsburgh. In 1959 he won the Premio dell\u2019Ariete in Milan and the UNESCO Prize at the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial. There was a solo show of Burri\u2019s art in 1960 at the Venice Biennale, where he was awarded the Critics\u2019 Prize.\nPersevering with the combustione technique, Burri started to burn plastic in the early 1960s and exhibited these works at the Marlborough Galleria d\u2019arte, Rome (1962).

After years of travel, his family settled in Chemnitz in 1890. From 1901 to 1905 he studied architecture at the Dresden Technische Hochschule, and pictorial art in Munich at the Kunsthochschule and at an experimental art school established by Wilhelm von Debschitz and Hermann Obrist. While in Munich he produced his first woodcuts; the graphic arts were to become as important to him as painting. At that time he was drawn to Neo-Impressionism as well as to the old masters.\nIn 1905 the Die Br\u00fccke (The Bridge) group was founded in Dresden by Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Kirchner, and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff; later, Cuno Amiet, Otto M\u00fcller, Emil Nolde, and Max Pechstein joined the group. From 1905 to 1910 Dresden hosted exhibitions of Post-Impressionism, including the work of Vincent van Gogh, as well as shows featuring Gustav Klimt, Edvard Munch, and the Fauves, who deeply impressed Kirchner. Other important influences were Japanese prints, and African and Oceanic art. Kirchner moved to Berlin with the Br\u00fccke group in 1911. The following year Franz Marc included works by Br\u00fccke artists in the second show of the Blaue Reiter (the Blue Rider) at Heinrich Thannhauser\u2019s Moderne Galerie in Munich, thus providing a link between the two groups. In 1913 Kirchner exhibited in the Armory Show in New York, and was given his first solo shows in Germany at the Museum Folkwang Hagen, and the Galerie Gurlitt, Berlin.

While in Munich he produced his first woodcuts; the graphic arts were to become as important to him as painting. At that time he was drawn to Neo-Impressionism as well as to the old masters.\nIn 1905 the Die Br\u00fccke (The Bridge) group was founded in Dresden by Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Kirchner, and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff; later, Cuno Amiet, Otto M\u00fcller, Emil Nolde, and Max Pechstein joined the group. From 1905 to 1910 Dresden hosted exhibitions of Post-Impressionism, including the work of Vincent van Gogh, as well as shows featuring Gustav Klimt, Edvard Munch, and the Fauves, who deeply impressed Kirchner. Other important influences were Japanese prints, and African and Oceanic art. Kirchner moved to Berlin with the Br\u00fccke group in 1911. The following year Franz Marc included works by Br\u00fccke artists in the second show of the Blaue Reiter (the Blue Rider) at Heinrich Thannhauser\u2019s Moderne Galerie in Munich, thus providing a link between the two groups. In 1913 Kirchner exhibited in the Armory Show in New York, and was given his first solo shows in Germany at the Museum Folkwang Hagen, and the Galerie Gurlitt, Berlin.

When Saura was young, his father took him to Madrid to visit the Museo del Prado, where he viewed paintings by Francisco de Goya and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. After he contracted tuberculosis at age thirteen and was confined to his bed for five years, Saura reflected on his visit to the Prado. In 1947, on his way to recovery and without formal training, he began to produce art. Initially he experimented with diverse mediums, including paint, lithography, engraving, prose, and poetry.\nIn 1954, Saura moved to Paris, where he met Benjamin P\u00e9ret and other Surrealists. His work of this period used biomorphic forms and recalled paintings by Joan Mir\u00f3. Settling in Madrid in 1957, he began to paint in a more severe style with subject matter confined to repeatable motifs, such as the female body and portraiture. Stylistically, his work drew from the expressive painters of the New York school as well as from Art Informel artists such as Jean Fautrier.\nSaura\u2019s return to Spain inspired a return to Spanish influences. In the 1950s and 1960s, he made a series of paintings of a crucifixion scene that recall Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s own 1632 composition at the Prado. Saura\u2019s limited palette, constrained brushstrokes, and gruesome subject matter also evoke Pablo Picasso\u2019s work of the late 1930s, especially the monochromatic Guernica (1937). Saura, like Picasso, was struck by the photographs of the bombing of the Basque capital, but Saura\u2019s expressive brushstrokes more directly index his emotional response to wartime death and destruction. In 1957 he founded the El Paso group (1957\u201360) with other artists based in Madrid. The group is considered part of the wider movement of Spanish Informalism, along with the Catalonian group Dau al Set (Seventh face of the die, 1948\u201353) and the painter Antoni T\u00e0pies. Before disbanding, El Paso took part in two exhibitions in New York: New Spanish Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art and Before Picasso, After Mir\u00f3 at the Guggenheim Museum (both 1960).\nThe continuous political upheaval of the 1960s left Saura with a conflicted relationship to his art. In 1965 and again in 1967, he destroyed hundreds of his paintings. In 1968, he abandoned oil painting altogether for ten years and worked in other mediums. Later in his career, Saura designed stage sets for ballets and performances, including a production of Carmen in Paris (1983). In 1995 he ventured into filmmaking, collaborating with his brother Carlos to make Flamenco, which featured the artist describing his painting process.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Huesca", "artistBirthDate": "1930", "artistDeathDate": "1998"}}, "500": {"paintingDate": "1958", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/76.2553.161_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

After studying painting at the Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts, Budapest, between 1941 and 1946, she traveled to Italy as the grantee of the Hungarian Academy, Rome. In October 1948, she returned to Hungary, which had been overtaken by a Soviet-style authoritarian regime. Determined to leave and after seven failed attempts, Reigl successfully crossed the Iron Curtain in March 1950 and a few months later arrived in Paris. Her earliest Parisian works, indebted to the oneiric imagery of Surrealism, include photo-collages as well as paintings of monstrous figures and of vividly colored phantasmagorical scenes, as in They Have an Insatiable Thirst for Infinity (Ils ont soif insatiable de l\u2019infini, 1950). From 1952, Reigl started to experiment with gestural paint application that expanded on the Surrealist practice of automatic writing. By painting and scraping the canvas, she produced abstract works that featured elongated, M\u00f6bius strip\u2013like biomorphic forms in glowing and often highly saturated colors. \nIn May 1954, fellow Hungarian painter Simon Hanta took Andr\u00e9 Breton to Reigl\u2019s studio; Breton immediately offered her a solo exhibition, which she at first turned down, then accepted in November. The show took place at L\u2019\u00c9toile scell\u00e9e, then the gallery of the Parisian Surrealist group, and was composed of both Reigl\u2019s figurative and abstract works. After the exhibition, she dissolved her connections with Breton and adopted a purely abstract and vigorously physical approach to painting. By hurling compounds of industrial pigment and linseed oil on the canvas and then molding them with various metal devices into explosive marks, she used her body as an instrument of painting. In resulting series such as Outburst (\u00c9clatement, 1955\u201358), Center of Dominance (Centre de dominance, 1958\u201359), and Mass Writing (\u00c9criture en masse, 1959\u201365), the streaks of pigment appear on white grounds in different spatial and chromatic configurations that suggest force fields, shaped by the kinetic energy of the artist\u2019s body and the gravity of paint. In Guano (1958\u201365), Reigl recycled a group of abandoned canvases that once covered her studio floor by painting over them: the works use the waste material of the studio and, as opposed to the immediacy of her gestural works, record the passage of time through the accumulated layers of thickly textured paint. \nIn 1963, Reigl left Paris and moved to Marcoussis, a village southwest of the capital. In February 1966, after noticing the emergence of an anthropomorphic figure in her work, she devoted a series of monumental paintings titled Man (Homme, 1966\u201372) to the representation of fragmented humans, mostly male torsos. In the series Unfolding (D\u00e9roulement, 1973\u201385), she resumed her interest in the spatial-temporal dimension of gesture. Created by the cadences of her moving body as well as by unorthodox paint applications that provoked bleeds through the weave of the canvas, the works in Unfolding feature horizontal rows of graphic signs that are visible on both sides of the paintings. In the late 1980s, she returned to the human figure and has continued her investigation of bodies and spaces ever since.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Kapuv\u00e1r", "artistBirthDate": "1923", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "465": {"paintingDate": "2009", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2012.159_cu_web_1.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

As a child of parents of the Indian diaspora who migrated to Thailand during Partition, his ancestry lies in the Hindi-Punjabi communities of present-day Pakistan. After receiving his BFA from Chiang Mai University in 1993, Rawanchaikul founded the Chiang Mai\u2013based Navin Production Co., Ltd., in 1994. Much of Rawanchaikul\u2019s own work is produced under the name of this company, which also functions as an artists\u2019 collective. Working in various mediums including sculpture, painting, performance, photography, and film, Rawanchaikul began his practice with community-driven projects aimed at integrating art into everyday contexts. \nIn Navin Gallery Bangkok (1995\u201398), Rawanchaikul questions modern methods of art making and exhibiting by converting an ordinary taxi into a mobile gallery featuring rotating exhibitions. The project was later executed in a number of international cities, including Sydney, London, Bonn, and New York, successfully attracting new audiences with the help of its unconventional format. Rawanchaikul\u2019s practice often relies on collaboration, as in the tongue-in-cheek Navin Party (2006), which involved a touring multimedia exhibition featuring a Bollywood-style music video, a billboard advertisement, and a series of propaganda posters, all aimed at connecting people with the first name Navin. The multipart work comments on what the artist frames as the transitory nature of the modern world\u2014revealed through the global occurrence of the Sanskrit-based name\u2014as well as referencing the way in which artists can find their ethnic origins exploited for commercial gain. By involving the participation of real or imagined communities, Rawanchaikul\u2019s practice transcends site-specificity to negotiate between local communities and globalization.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Chiang Mai", "artistBirthDate": "1971", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "464": {"paintingDate": "1963", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/82.2912_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He began to study pharmacology at the University of Texas, Austin, before being drafted into the U.S. Navy, where he served as a neuropsychiatric technician in the U.S. Navy Hospital Corps in San Diego. In 1947, he enrolled at the Kansas City Art Institute and traveled to Paris to study at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian the following year.\nIn fall 1948, Rauschenberg returned to the United States to study under Josef Albers at Black Mountain College near Asheville, North Carolina. During intermittent study there through 1952, he met avant-garde creative partners John Cage and Merce Cunningham, with whom he would later collaborate. While taking classes at the Art Students League, New York, from 1949 to 1951, Rauschenberg was offered his first solo exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery. Some works from this period include blueprints, monochromatic white paintings, and black paintings. From fall 1952 to spring 1953, he traveled to Europe and North Africa with Cy Twombly, whom he had met at the Art Students League. During his travels, Rauschenberg worked on a series of small collages, hanging assemblages, and small boxes filled with found elements, which he exhibited in Rome and Florence.\nOn his return to New York in 1953, Rauschenberg completed his series of black paintings, using newspaper as the ground, and began work on sculptures created from wood, stones, and other materials found on the street; paintings made with tissue paper, dirt, or gold leaf; and more conceptually oriented works such as Automobile Tire Print (1953) and Erased de Kooning Drawing (1953). By the end of 1953, he had begun his Red Painting series (1953\u201354) on canvases that incorporated newspapers, fabric, and found objects and evolved in 1954 into the Combines, a term Rauschenberg coined for his well-known works that integrated aspects of painting and sculpture and would often include such objects as a stuffed eagle or goat, street signs, or a quilt and pillow. In late 1953, he met Jasper Johns; together, Johns and Rauschenberg are now considered the most influential artists who reacted against Abstract Expressionism. They had neighboring studios, regularly exchanging ideas and discussing their work, until 1961. From 1954 to 1964, and again in 1977, Rauschenberg also worked with Cage and Cunningham, contributing scenic, costume, and lighting design to the latter\u2019s dance company.\nRauschenberg began to silkscreen paintings in 1962. He had his first retrospective, organized by the Jewish Museum, New York, in 1963 and was awarded the Grand Prize for painting at the 1964 Venice Biennale. He spent much of the remainder of the 1960s dedicated to more collaborative projects, including printmaking, performance, choreography, set design, and art-and-technology works. In 1966, he cofounded Experiments in Art and Technology, an organization that sought to promote collaborations between artists and engineers.\nOver the following decades his work continued to encompass a variety of fields. In the summer of 1970, joining a protest movement in the arts against the Vietnam War, Rauschenberg withdrew from the U.S. Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. In September that same year, he founded Change, a nonprofit organization to assist artists-in-need with emergency expenses.\nBy the end of 1970, Rauschenberg had established a permanent residence and studio in Captiva Island, Florida. He eventually acquired 20 acres of the island to use a workspace and serve as a nature preserve. His first project on Captiva was a 16.5-meter-long silkscreen print called Currents (1970), made with newspapers from the first two months of the year, followed by Cardboards (1970\u201371) and Early Egyptians (1973\u201374), the latter of which is a series of wall reliefs and sculptures constructed from used boxes. He also printed on textiles using his solvent-transfer technique to make the Hoarfrosts (1974\u201376) and Spreads (1975\u201382), and for the Jammers (1975\u201376), he created a series of colorful silk wall and floor works.\nA retrospective organized by the National Collection of Fine Arts (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum), Washington, D.C., traveled throughout the United States in 1976 and 1978. In 1977 Rauschenberg, Cunningham, and Cage reconnected as collaborators for the first time in 13 years, when the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, New York, performed Travelogue (1977), for which Rauschenberg contributed the costume and set designs.\nIn 1980, after he settled a copyright lawsuit brought against him for an earlier appropriation of an advertisement, Rauschenberg shifted to exclusively using his own photographs as material for works that involved photography. His return to that medium led to exhibitions in Florida and Paris over the next two years, which, for the first time, featured his black-and-white photographs from the 1950s, as well as his more current photographs taken in various cities around the United States. In 1981 he began work on The 1/4 Mile or Two Furlong Piece (1981\u20132008), conceived by the artist to be the longest artwork in the world, eventually extending beyond the length designated in the title. It encompassed a wide range of Rauschenberg\u2019s techniques and a chronology of his imagery.\nRauschenberg traveled extensively throughout his life. In the mid-1980s his collaborations with artisans and workshops abroad culminated in the establishment of the Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI). Announced to the United Nations in December 1984, ROCI involved the artist making and presenting work while traveling with a team of assistants through 11 politically sensitive countries, including China, Tibet, the U.S.S.R., and East Germany, as a way to initiate cross-cultural dialogue. Some works remained in their original sites as gifts and others traveled with the ROCI team to be shared with future participants. Rauschenberg personally funded the project, which concluded in 1991 with an exhibition of over 125 works at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\nBased on his introduction to painting and screenprinting on copper during ROCI Chile in 1985, Rauschenberg created multiple series, such as Urban Bourbons (1988\u201395), that focused on different methods of transferring images onto a variety of reflective metals, such as steel and aluminum. In addition, throughout the 1990s, Rauschenberg continued to use new materials while still working with more rudimentary techniques, such as wet fresco, as in the series Arcadian Retreat (1996), and the transfer of images by hand, as in the Anagrams (1995\u20132000). As part of his engagement with the latest technology, he began making digital Iris prints and using biodegradable vegetable dyes in his transfer processes, underscoring his commitment to caring for the environment. During this time, he also designed costumes and sets for several major productions by the Trisha Brown Dance Company, New York. Despite a stroke in 2002 that paralyzed his right side, he continued to make work in his Captiva Island studio.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Port Arthur", "artistBirthDate": "1925", "artistDeathDate": "2008"}}, "467": {"paintingDate": "1915", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/38.380_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In New York he frequented Alfred Stieglitz's gallery \"291\" in 1911 and attended classes at the Ferrer Center in 1912. In 1915 his first solo show was held at the Daniel Gallery, New York. About this time he took up photography, the medium for which he was to become best known. He entered into a lifelong friendship with Marcel Duchamp, with whom he and Walter Arensberg founded the Society of Independent Artists in 1916. With Duchamp, Katherine Dreier, Henry Hudson, and Andrew McLaren, Man Ray established the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme, which he named, in 1920. Before the artist moved from New York to Paris in 1921, Man Ray and Duchamp published the single issue of New York Dada.\nIn Paris Man Ray was given a solo exhibition at the Librairie Six in 1921. His first Rayographs (photographic images produced without a camera) were published in Les Champs d\u00e9licieux, rayographies in 1922, the year the artist participated in the Salon Dada at the Galerie Montaigne in Paris. With Jean Arp, Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Joan Mir\u00f3, and Pablo Picasso, he was represented in the first Surrealist exhibition at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. From 1923 to 1929 he made the films Le Retour \u00e0 la raison, Emak Bakia, L'Etoile de mer, and Les Myst\u00e8res du ch\u00e2teau de d\u00e9. In 1932 Man Ray's work was included in Dada, 1916\u20131932 at the Galerie de l'Institut in Paris and in a Surrealist show at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York. He collaborated with Paul Eluard on the books Facile in 1935 and Les Mains libres in 1937.

She received her BA in painting from Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York (1983), after which she attended the postgraduate program in painting at the National College of Art and Design, Dublin (1984), and the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes en arts plastiques, Paris (1989). She was awarded a Rome Prize fellowship in 1992. From 2005 through 2008, Quaytman served as the director of Orchard, an interdisciplinary and intergenerational artist-run gallery in New York\u2019s Lower East Side. Through her meticulous and systematic practice, Quaytman challenges historically determined assumptions about the relationship between viewer and painting, and questions painting\u2019s autonomy as a means of visual communication by foregrounding, within her work, the context of its reception.\nQuaytman\u2019s paintings, at once pictorially abstract and conceptually resonant, reference a range of sources, including her own family history, phenomenology, social relationships, and the conventions of modernist painting. Always working on wood panels with predetermined proportions, Quaytman employs a muted palette and a range of formal techniques such as screenprinting, trompe l\u2019oeil, and even the application of diamond dust to the work\u2019s surface to create deceptively straightforward and visually evocative compositions. Quaytman has also displayed her paintings on storage racks placed within the exhibition space, pointing to the eventual passage into obscurity of most aesthetic objects as they make space for others. Since 2001, she has organized her paintings into \u201cchapters,\u201d each of which is conceptualized around a particular exhibition and evolves from a specific formal concept. For the 2008\u201309 grouping Chapter 12: iamb, for example, she took as her starting point the motif of a painting lit by a lamp, which has the potential to both illuminate and create blind spots through its reflection. The decision to imitate the structure of a book in her work reflects Quaytman\u2019s belief that images and their meanings are inherently contingent. The meaning of each painting is dependent not only on the person standing before it but also on the image next to it. Likewise, each chapter is informed by those that came before. In 2011, Quaytman made this approach literal with the publication of the artist\u2019s book Spine, a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of sorts in which she revisited the twenty chapters that make up her preceding decade\u2019s output. In Quaytman\u2019s works, meaning is fluid, traditional categories are perpetually destabilized, and perspective is subject to multiple shifts. Her paintings establish their own visual lexicon without jettisoning existing systems of signification.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Boston", "artistBirthDate": "1961", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "463": {"paintingDate": "1962\u201363", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/97.4566_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In addition, throughout the 1990s, Rauschenberg continued to use new materials while still working with more rudimentary techniques, such as wet fresco, as in the series Arcadian Retreat (1996), and the transfer of images by hand, as in the Anagrams (1995\u20132000). As part of his engagement with the latest technology, he began making digital Iris prints and using biodegradable vegetable dyes in his transfer processes, underscoring his commitment to caring for the environment. During this time, he also designed costumes and sets for several major productions by the Trisha Brown Dance Company, New York.

He began to study pharmacology at the University of Texas, Austin, before being drafted into the U.S. Navy, where he served as a neuropsychiatric technician in the U.S. Navy Hospital Corps in San Diego. In 1947, he enrolled at the Kansas City Art Institute and traveled to Paris to study at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian the following year.\nIn fall 1948, Rauschenberg returned to the United States to study under Josef Albers at Black Mountain College near Asheville, North Carolina. During intermittent study there through 1952, he met avant-garde creative partners John Cage and Merce Cunningham, with whom he would later collaborate. While taking classes at the Art Students League, New York, from 1949 to 1951, Rauschenberg was offered his first solo exhibition at the Betty Parsons Gallery. Some works from this period include blueprints, monochromatic white paintings, and black paintings. From fall 1952 to spring 1953, he traveled to Europe and North Africa with Cy Twombly, whom he had met at the Art Students League. During his travels, Rauschenberg worked on a series of small collages, hanging assemblages, and small boxes filled with found elements, which he exhibited in Rome and Florence.\nOn his return to New York in 1953, Rauschenberg completed his series of black paintings, using newspaper as the ground, and began work on sculptures created from wood, stones, and other materials found on the street; paintings made with tissue paper, dirt, or gold leaf; and more conceptually oriented works such as Automobile Tire Print (1953) and Erased de Kooning Drawing (1953). By the end of 1953, he had begun his Red Painting series (1953\u201354) on canvases that incorporated newspapers, fabric, and found objects and evolved in 1954 into the Combines, a term Rauschenberg coined for his well-known works that integrated aspects of painting and sculpture and would often include such objects as a stuffed eagle or goat, street signs, or a quilt and pillow. In late 1953, he met Jasper Johns; together, Johns and Rauschenberg are now considered the most influential artists who reacted against Abstract Expressionism. They had neighboring studios, regularly exchanging ideas and discussing their work, until 1961. From 1954 to 1964, and again in 1977, Rauschenberg also worked with Cage and Cunningham, contributing scenic, costume, and lighting design to the latter\u2019s dance company.\nRauschenberg began to silkscreen paintings in 1962. He had his first retrospective, organized by the Jewish Museum, New York, in 1963 and was awarded the Grand Prize for painting at the 1964 Venice Biennale. He spent much of the remainder of the 1960s dedicated to more collaborative projects, including printmaking, performance, choreography, set design, and art-and-technology works. In 1966, he cofounded Experiments in Art and Technology, an organization that sought to promote collaborations between artists and engineers.\nOver the following decades his work continued to encompass a variety of fields. In the summer of 1970, joining a protest movement in the arts against the Vietnam War, Rauschenberg withdrew from the U.S. Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. In September that same year, he founded Change, a nonprofit organization to assist artists-in-need with emergency expenses.\nBy the end of 1970, Rauschenberg had established a permanent residence and studio in Captiva Island, Florida. He eventually acquired 20 acres of the island to use a workspace and serve as a nature preserve. His first project on Captiva was a 16.5-meter-long silkscreen print called Currents (1970), made with newspapers from the first two months of the year, followed by Cardboards (1970\u201371) and Early Egyptians (1973\u201374), the latter of which is a series of wall reliefs and sculptures constructed from used boxes. He also printed on textiles using his solvent-transfer technique to make the Hoarfrosts (1974\u201376) and Spreads (1975\u201382), and for the Jammers (1975\u201376), he created a series of colorful silk wall and floor works.\nA retrospective organized by the National Collection of Fine Arts (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum), Washington, D.C., traveled throughout the United States in 1976 and 1978. In 1977 Rauschenberg, Cunningham, and Cage reconnected as collaborators for the first time in 13 years, when the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, New York, performed Travelogue (1977), for which Rauschenberg contributed the costume and set designs.\nIn 1980, after he settled a copyright lawsuit brought against him for an earlier appropriation of an advertisement, Rauschenberg shifted to exclusively using his own photographs as material for works that involved photography. His return to that medium led to exhibitions in Florida and Paris over the next two years, which, for the first time, featured his black-and-white photographs from the 1950s, as well as his more current photographs taken in various cities around the United States. In 1981 he began work on The 1/4 Mile or Two Furlong Piece (1981\u20132008), conceived by the artist to be the longest artwork in the world, eventually extending beyond the length designated in the title. It encompassed a wide range of Rauschenberg\u2019s techniques and a chronology of his imagery.\nRauschenberg traveled extensively throughout his life. In the mid-1980s his collaborations with artisans and workshops abroad culminated in the establishment of the Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI). Announced to the United Nations in December 1984, ROCI involved the artist making and presenting work while traveling with a team of assistants through 11 politically sensitive countries, including China, Tibet, the U.S.S.R., and East Germany, as a way to initiate cross-cultural dialogue.

Mendelson was a founding member of the avant-garde group Jeune Peinture Belge (also known as Jonge Belgische Schilderkunst, young Belgian painters, 1945\u201348). Aiming to promote the progressive work of young Belgian artists in the immediate post\u2013World War II period, the group\u2019s main exhibition took place in 1947 at the Palais des beaux-arts, Brussels. Mendelson subsequently showed at the Venice Biennale (1948) and the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial (1951, 1953), and he received an honorable mention at the Carnegie International, Pittsburgh (1952). He was also included in Younger European Painters: A Selection (1953\u201354) at the Guggenheim Museum. This same year he was commissioned to produce murals for Kursaal Oostende, Ostend, Belgium, and, in collaboration with fellow Jeune Peinture Belge member Louis van Lint and architect Roger Thirion, murals for Restaurant Canterbury, Ostend.

His paintings are subsumed by a type of California spirit evident in their vibrant colors, which are reminiscent of Technicolor films or commercial photography. One of the 13 seminal Photorealist painters, McLean is also one of the foremost painters of horses in contemporary art.\nMcLean\u2019s large-scale canvases exhibit the slick finish and exaggerated accuracy typical of Photorealism. An offshoot of Pop art that emerged in the United States during the late 1960s, the movement was pioneered by McLean as well as such artists as Chuck Close, Richard Estes, Audrey Flack, and Malcolm Morley. McLean\u2019s major body of painting resulted from translations of color Kodachromes, which in turn were based on black-and-white photographs, as featured in monthly magazines dedicated to horse breeding and showmanship.

Raised by a prominent Roman Catholic family of Spanish and Franco-Basque origin, he studied architecture at the Colegio del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n and Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, both in Santiago. Seeking work, he moved to Europe in 1933, taking a position as a draftsman in the architectural studio of Le Corbusier in Paris, which he held until 1937. During this time, while visiting family in Spain and Portugal, Matta was introduced to the poets Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, Gabriela Mistral, and Pablo Neruda. Through Garc\u00eda Lorca, Matta became familiar with Surrealism and received an introduction to Salvador Dal\u00ed, who in turn introduced him to Andr\u00e9 Breton. Around 1937, having shown Breton his fantastical architectural drawings, Matta joined the Surrealist group. He experimented with automatic writing alongside Yves Tanguy and Gordon Onslow-Ford, and in 1938 made his first paintings, called \u201cinscapes\u201d or \u201cpsychological morphologies,\u201d characterized by bright colors and the fusion of architectural space and biomorphic forms. \nIn 1939 Matta moved to the United States. Being multilingual and one of the youngest Surrealist expatriates, he quickly formed relationships with the new generation of New York painters. While living in the city, he explored automatic painting with artists such as William Baziotes, Arshile Gorky, and Robert Motherwell. Due to these relationships, Matta is often credited with playing an integral role in the development of Abstract Expressionism. During the mid-1940s Matta regularly visited with Marcel Duchamp, and he mostly disengaged from the American scene since his style increasingly encompassed anthropomorphic figuration instead of pure abstraction. \nIn 1948 Matta returned to Paris, where he was surprised to find that he had been expelled from the Surrealist group. He became less interested in representing his inner self through personal symbols and more concerned with expressing universal social experiences through recognizable forms. From 1950 to 1954 Matta lived in Rome, before returning once again to Paris. He became a French citizen in 1969. In the 1960s and 1970s Matta became involved in Latin American politics, supporting the Cuban revolutionaries, as well as the pro-government mural painters surrounding Chilean president Salvador Allende. He continued to paint and exhibit throughout his later years while living between London, Milan, Paris, and Tarquinia, Italy.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Santiago", "artistBirthDate": "1911", "artistDeathDate": "2002"}}, "351": {"paintingDate": "1916", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/82.2946_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In paintings, prints, and architectural installations that marry highly saturated color harmonies with geometric abstraction, Milhazes demonstrates an allegiance to both European and Brazilian modernism. She cites Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, and Tarsila do Amaral as her three primary influences, and all three figures are a strong presence within her work.\nIn the mid-1990s, Milhazes adopted an idiosyncratic method of collaging paint that has remained her signature technique. First, she paints a vibrantly colored abstract design onto a transparent sheet of plastic. She sticks this sheet to the canvas and then peels it off, leaving the layer of paint. Milhazes repeats this process many times for each work, creating a multilayered yet flat picture that seems to collapse together several moments in time. The sequential steps of this method remain visible in the finished piece, inviting close looking and intimate connection. Milhazes has said, \u201cI love painting, but I do not want the texture of the brushstrokes or the \u2018hand\u2019 of the painter to be visible on my canvases.\u201d\u00b9 Both this love of painting and the consequences of her technique are richly evident in the collaged-on designs, which retain an organic feel in their wildly colorful combination of graceful arabesques, geometric abstraction, and floral patterns. \nMilhazes\u2019s first major museum exhibition was organized in 2001 by Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, England, and traveled later that year to the Birmingham Museum of Art, Alabama. Her work was included in the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial in 2002 and 2004, and in 2003 she represented Brazil at the Venice Biennale. In 2009, the Fondation Cartier pour l\u2019art contemporain, Paris, mounted a large-scale retrospective that included two new, site-specific installations on the building\u2019s exterior glass walls.

Milhazes repeats this process many times for each work, creating a multilayered yet flat picture that seems to collapse together several moments in time. The sequential steps of this method remain visible in the finished piece, inviting close looking and intimate connection. Milhazes has said, \u201cI love painting, but I do not want the texture of the brushstrokes or the \u2018hand\u2019 of the painter to be visible on my canvases.\u201d\u00b9 Both this love of painting and the consequences of her technique are richly evident in the collaged-on designs, which retain an organic feel in their wildly colorful combination of graceful arabesques, geometric abstraction, and floral patterns. \nMilhazes\u2019s first major museum exhibition was organized in 2001 by Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, England, and traveled later that year to the Birmingham Museum of Art, Alabama. Her work was included in the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial in 2002 and 2004, and in 2003 she represented Brazil at the Venice Biennale. In 2009, the Fondation Cartier pour l\u2019art contemporain, Paris, mounted a large-scale retrospective that included two new, site-specific installations on the building\u2019s exterior glass walls. Milhazes has created several public art projects, including G\u00e1vea (2004) at the Selfridges department store in Manchester, Peace and Love (2005\u201306) at the Gloucester Road tube station in London, Maracolouco (2008) at the Tokyo Museum of Contemporary Art, and Bailinho (2008) at the Pinacoteca do estado de S\u00e3o Paulo.

His siblings shared his interest in art; he devoted himself to painting while his older brothers Dino and Mirko became sculptors. Afro studied in Florence and Venice, and in 1932 his first solo exhibition was held at Galleria del Milione, Milan. In 1933 Afro started working in a figurative style rich in symbolic accents and pale and ethereal tones, akin to that of the Scuola Romana (Roman School), with which he was temporarily affiliated. Afro moved to Rome in 1938, but served in the Italian army (and participated in the anti-Fascist Resistance) during World War II. He also taught mosaic design at the Accademia di belle arti, Venice, and his work took a new slant, as figuration gradually gave way to a growing interest in Cubism. \nReturning to Rome in 1945, Afro encountered tensions between proponents of abstraction and those who favored realism, but he was only marginally involved in these controversies. By the end of the decade he had developed a strand of abstraction based on intersecting geometric planes and expressive juxtapositions of color and light. Increasingly weary of the polemics among painters in Italy, Afro turned his attention to the American scene. In 1950 he traveled to New York for the opening of a group show of Italian artists at the Catherine Viviano Gallery, a venue that hosted his first U.S. solo exhibition later that year and regular exhibitions of his work through 1968.\nFrom 1952 Afro's painting took a new direction, adding fluid signs, rounded contours, and a brighter palette and replacing the angular forms and quasi-monochromatic pictorial language of earlier years. That same year he joined the Gruppo degli Otto Pittori Italiani (Group of eight Italian painters, 1952\u201354), whose \"abstract-concrete\" leanings represented an alternative to the Italian abstraction-realism polarization. The group exhibited together at the 1952 Venice Biennale, but by 1954 Afro had distanced himself from the Otto\u2014a move that coincided with the introduction of an increasingly dynamic gesture in his works. More dramatic and spontaneous, Afro's late 1950s works testify to his growing interest in Abstract Expressionism, amplified by his friendship with Willem de Kooning, who stayed in Afro's studio in Rome in 1959, and Afro's frequent visits to the United States. James Johnson Sweeney, art critic and former director of the Guggenheim Museum, authored an early monograph on Afro in 1961. Afro's paintings of the 1960s were increasingly gestural, a tendency that he reversed at the end of the decade when his works became more synthetic and geometric. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Udine", "artistBirthDate": "1912", "artistDeathDate": "1976"}}, "281": {"paintingDate": "1946", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/93.4233_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

It emphasized the use of raw physical materials left to scatter, lean, drop, or break according to their situation. Applying structuralism, phenomenology, and Asian metaphysics in dialogue with international Post-Minimalist practices, Arte Povera, Nouveau R\u00e9alisme, and Land art, he developed a radical artistic language revolving around the notion of encounter\u2014seeing the bare existence of what is actually before us and focusing on \"the world as it is.\"\nLee's sculptural works from this period, which he refers as k\u014dz\u014d, or \"living structures,\" are distinguished by a move away from expression and toward a detached act of arranging or mediating. These works are often titled Relatum (1968\u2013), a Latin term denoting \"relation,\" and operate in an expanded field where the artist's creative gesture resides in the choreographed confluence of the object, the viewer, and the resonant surrounding space. Similarly, his paintings incorporate vast areas of white space that function as a productive site of possibility rather than a void or negative space.\nIn the early 1970s, Lee received significant attention at Tokyo's leading galleries and museums and began exhibiting in West Germany and France, including at the 1971 Paris Youth Biennale, which introduced Mono-ha to Europe and led him to establish a studio in Paris that year. In the wake of Abstract Expressionism in the United States and Art Informel in Europe, Lee developed the iconic From Point and From Line series (1972\u201384). Here Lee employed a monochrome palette and iterative brush strokes moving horizontally or vertically across the canvas to chart the passage of lived time. This body of work garnered critical acclaim in Asia and became especially influential in his home country of Korea, where he became a seminal figure in the tansaekhwa (monochrome painting) school.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Kyongnam", "artistBirthDate": "1936", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "286": {"paintingDate": "1912", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/53.1362_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He completed secondary school at the Voskresensky Technical High School in Moscow, and at the age of 17 began studying at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. In 1900, he met fellow student Natalia Goncharova, and the two began their long-term collaboration and partnership. His early work included Impressionist landscapes, several of which he exhibited at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in 1906. Exposed to and influenced by contemporary French painting, he began using strategies of Symbolism, and in 1908 co-organized an exhibition of modern French painting in Moscow with the arts journal Zolotoye runo (Golden Fleece), which included work of the Post-Impressionists and Fauves. Larionov's Evening after the Rain (Posle dozhdia, 1909) employs the bright color and coarse brushwork of the latter. In 1910, he cofounded the Bubnovyi valet (Jack of Diamonds) group, composed of several Russian artists with an interest in Primitivism and the appropriation of provincial folk art. In 1911 he cofounded Oslinyi Khvost (Donkey's Tail) with Goncharova, a second and more radical primitivist group that was much more focused on Russian primitivism, to the exclusion of foreign influence. In 1912 the group staged its first exhibition at Moscow's Stroganov Art Institute, and in 1913 published the related journal Oslinyi khvost I mishen (Donkey's Tail and Target).\nLater that year, Larionov initiated two highly influential movements: Rayism and Neo-Primitivism. Rayism, the tenets of which were outlined in three 1913 manifestos by Larionov, was inspired by Italian Futurism and was the first emergence of near-abstract art in Russia; Rayonisme (Domination du rouge) (Rayonist Composition: Domination of Red, 1912\u201313) is an early example of the style's pre-Constructivist mass of slanting lines and painted rays of light. Neo-Primitivism, for which Larionov became known among the European avant-garde, was a fusion of his interests in Fauvism and Expressionism. The style is evident in Boulevard Venus (Promenade [V\u00e9nus sur un boulevard], 1913), a cubo-futurist portrait of a dress-and-heels-clad prostitute in motion, which combined broad strokes of red, green, and yellow paint with multiple perspectives. Larionov and Goncharova left Russia in 1915 for Lausanne and Paris, touring with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes: Larionov's commissions for Diaghilev included designs for the ballets The Midnight Sun (Soleil de nuit) in Switzerland in 1915 and Russian Tales (Contes russes) in Paris in 1917; the latter, sumptuous and based on Russian folktales, solidified his international reputation.\nBy 1919, he had settled in Paris, where he often collaborated with Cubist and Dada painters and poets, and organized the first major exhibition of modern French art for the Soviet Union in 1928 at Moscow's Tretyakov Gallery. He also began to focus on graphic work: he published in the fourth Bauhaus portfolio, and contributed illustrations to Vladimir Mayakovsky's canonical poem, \"The Sun,\" in 1923. Throughout the 1920s, he continued to work for Diaghilev as a set designer and artistic advisor, returning to painting (primarily figurative oils) only after Diaghilev's death in 1929. However, he continued to study dance and occasionally design for the ballet. After gaining French citizenship in 1938, falling into relative obscurity, and spending the war years confined to his and Goncharova's apartment due to poor health, he suffered a stroke in 1950 and spent his remaining years in poverty, dying in a rest home at Fontenay-aux-Roses near Paris in 1964.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Tiraspol", "artistBirthDate": "1881", "artistDeathDate": "1964"}}, "263": {"paintingDate": "1937", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/48.1172.59_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

His use of housepainters\u2019 brushes produced tiny splatters and inflections on the canvas that enhanced the explosive quality of his black lines.\nLike many fellow Abstract Expressionists, such as De Kooning and Mark Rothko, Kline took his work in several different directions in the late 1950s.

While still a student, he painted fans and postcards for the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte, which published his first book of poetry in 1908. That same year, Kokoschka was fiercely criticized for the works he exhibited in the Vienna Kunstschau and consequently was dismissed from the Kunstgewerbeschule. At this time, he attracted the attention of the architect Adolf Loos, who became his most vigorous supporter. In this early period, Kokoschka wrote plays that are considered among the first examples of expressionist drama.\nHis first solo show was held at the Galerie Paul Cassirer, Berlin, in 1910, followed later that year by another at the Museum Folkwang Essen. In 1910, he also began to contribute to Herwarth Walden\u2019s periodical Der Sturm. Kokoschka concentrated on portraiture, dividing his time between Berlin and Vienna from 1910 to 1914. In 1915, shortly after the outbreak of World War I, he volunteered to serve on the eastern front, where he was seriously wounded. Still recuperating in 1917, he settled in Dresden and in 1919 accepted a professorship at the Akademie there.

During his school years in Kleve, Beuys was exposed to the work of Achilles Moortgat, whose studio he often visited, and was inspired by the sculptures of Wilhelm Lehmbruck. Beuys began to study medicine in 1940, but his studies were interrupted when he joined the army and served as a fighter pilot. During a mission in 1943, he was badly injured when his plane crashed in a desolate region of south Russia. This experience would resonate in all of his later work.\nAfter the war, he decided to dedicate his life to art. In 1947, he registered at the Staatliche Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf, where he studied under Joseph Enseling and Ewald Matar\u00e9. After Beuys graduated in 1951, the brothers Franz Joseph and Hans van der Grinten began to collect his work. Eventually becoming his most important patrons, they organized his first solo show at their house in Kranenburg in 1953. Beuys was appointed professor of monumental sculpture at the Staatliche Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf in 1961. The year after, he began to associate with Fluxus artists, principally Nam June Paik and George Maciunas, and later he met Minimalist artist Robert Morris. He helped to organize the Festum Fluxorum Fluxus at the Staatliche Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf in 1963, and he participated for the first time in Documenta in Kassel in 1964.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Krefeld", "artistBirthDate": "1921", "artistDeathDate": "1986"}}, "53": {"paintingDate": "2001", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2001.72_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

From a young age, Bradford worked in his mother\u2019s salon and referred to himself as a \u201cbeauty operator,\u201d continuing to do so even as he earned recognition in the visual arts. Bradford\u2019s early work often incorporated the tools of his trade, including singed permanent-wave endpapers, cellophane hair color, and human hair. In collage paintings like Daddy, Daddy, Daddy (2001), Bradford overlaid the translucent endpapers parallel to one another, their burned edges forming an imperfect, all-over grid. The corporeal mediums and delicate colors create a sense of intimacy and even nostalgia. However, this large-scale work\u2019s burnt materials and compulsive, labor-intensive process could appear threatening, as reminders of a culturally mandated beauty regime. Though the composition is abstract, the materials evoke elements of Bradford\u2019s personal narrative as well as the social and political significance of hair styling\u2014especially hair straightening\u2014in the black community. \nIn the mid-2000s, Bradford expanded his focus to examine the broader economic and racial geography of the communities in which he lived. In works like Black Venus (2005) and Scorched Earth (2006), he created imaginative maps of affluent black neighborhoods. The densely textured, vibrantly colored surfaces are built up from materials salvaged from the artist\u2019s Los Angeles neighborhood and collaged into exploded grids that recall both the vernacular abstraction of mapmaking as well as the utopian abstractions of the modernists. From similar materials, Bradford has also made a series of \u201cmerchant posters\u201d (2006\u2013), inspired by the advertisements hung informally around inner-city areas. In these works, layers of billboard paper overlaid on texts outlined in string have been sanded down to reveal fragments of the original phrases, and they are displayed singly or in large accumulations that recall the sites where these ads typically hang. The texts, which offer services ranging from DNA testing to expedited immigration papers, target individuals in times of personal or economic crisis and provide a window into the challenges facing urban communities. \nAlongside his work in painting and collage, Bradford has also explored issues of race, class, and gender in video, photography, sculpture, and installation. In the video Practice (2003) the artist struggles to play basketball while impeded by a modified Los Angeles Lakers uniform that includes an oversized antebellum-style hoop skirt. For Prospect.1 New Orleans (2008\u201309), the biennial organized in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Bradford built and installed Mithra (2008), a massive ark built from shipping containers and recycled plywood fencing plastered with peeling ads, in the city\u2019s stricken Ninth Ward. In Pinocchio Is On Fire (2010), a multimedia installation created for a retrospective at the Wexner Center for the Arts, Ohio State University, Columbus, Bradford appears in the guise of a fictional character based on R & B singer Teddy Pendergrass and is featured on album covers and in musical recordings and interviews.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Los Angeles", "artistBirthDate": "1961", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "52": {"paintingDate": "1934\u201335", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/38.432_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

That same year, Bonnard also attended the Acad\u00e9mie Julian and in 1888 entered the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, where he met Ker-Xavier Roussel and Edouard Vuillard, who became his lifelong friends. Thus Bonnard gave up law to become an artist, and, after brief military service, in 1889 he joined the group of young painters called the Nabis (the prophets), which was organized by Paul S\u00e9rusier and included Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, Roussel, Vuillard, and others. The Nabis, influenced by Paul Gauguin and Japanese prints, experimented with arbitrary color, expressive line, a wide range of mediums, and flat, patterned surfaces.\nIn 1890 Bonnard shared a studio with Vuillard and Denis, and he began to make color lithographs. The following year he met Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Also in 1891 he had his first show at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants and in the Nabis\u2019s earliest exhibitions at Le Barc de Boutteville. Bonnard exhibited with the Nabis until they disbanded in 1900. He worked in a variety of mediums; for example, he frequently made posters and illustrations for La Revue blanche, and in 1895 he designed a stained-glass window for Louis Comfort Tiffany. His first solo show, at the Galerie Durand-Ruel in 1896, included paintings, posters, and lithographs.

Although he is considered the father of Latin American Constructivism, he spent over 40 years of his life in the United States and Europe. Due to financial difficulties, his father moved the family to his homeland of Catalonia, Spain, in June 1891. It was there, in the town of Matar\u00f3, that Torres-Garc\u00eda studied drawing at the Escuela municipal de artes y oficios de Matar\u00f3 and painting under the artist Josep Vinardell. While he was a student there, he painted in oil, executing landscapes, interiors, and still lifes. In 1892 his family moved to Barcelona, where he attended the Academia de bellas artes before enrolling in the more prestigious Academia Baixas, and frequented the avant-garde artist caf\u00e9 Els Quatre Gats, which was the haunt of writers, intellectuals, and artists such as Pablo Picasso. During this time he made the acquaintance of the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, with whom he collaborated, from about 1903 to 1907, on the Templo expiatorio de la Sagrada Familia and the stained glass windows of the cathedral of Palma de Mallorca.\nIn 1918 he started to design wood toys as an extension of his teaching assignments; these toys integrated very simple forms into highly complex constructions, an early example of what he would do in his later Constructivist art production. He continued to design them after his move to New York in 1920, and they were manufactured for sale in 1922 after he returned to Europe that year. He settled in Paris in 1926, and after a rejection from the 1928 Salon d'automne, began to experiment with Constructivism, creating his first truly Constructivist works in 1929. His mature work from this latter period delicately balances natural and plastic elements, often containing signs that reference the indigenous cultures of South America. Late in 1929, Torres-Garc\u00eda met Piet Mondrian, and along with Michel Seuphor the three later founded the movement Cercle et Carr\u00e9 (Circle and Square). The group went public in 1930 with an eponymous journal and a group exhibition of 46 Constructivist artists at Galerie 23, Paris. The main goal of Cercle et Carr\u00e9 was to provide an artistic alternative to the dominant Parisian movement of Surrealism, and the association served as a forum for abstract artists to explore their ideas. Torres-Garc\u00eda ultimately left the group in 1930 after several disagreements with Seuphor.\nAfter a short period of time in Madrid, where he exhibited, taught, and gave lectures, Torres-Garc\u00eda returned to Uruguay in April 1934. There he founded the Asociaci\u00f3n de arte constructivo (Association of Constructivist Artists) and published the journal Circulo y cuadrado, which introduced the avant-garde art movements of Cubism, Neoplasticism, and Constructivism to artists in his home country. He published extensively on the theory of art, and partly due to his 1935 call for artists to invert the traditional hierarchy of art by placing Latin America before Europe in his text Escuela del sur (School of the South), has many Latin American followers.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Montevideo", "artistBirthDate": "1874", "artistDeathDate": "1949"}}, "536": {"paintingDate": "1989", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/GBM1997.11_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Guggenheim Museum Bilbao", "material": "Mixed media on canvas", "paintingName": "Ambroisia", "paintingNo": 536, "paintingLocationPlace": "Bilbao", "artist": {"artistNo": 1, "artistDeathPlace": "Barcelona", "artistDeathCountry": "", "artistName": "Antoni T\u00e0pies", "artistBirthCountry": "", "biography": "Antoni T\u00e0pies was born on December 13, 1923, in Barcelona.

He soon developed a recognizable personal style related to mati\u00e9risme (matter art), or Art Informel, a movement that focused on the materials of art making. The approach resulted in textural richness, but its more important aim was exploring the transformative qualities of matter. T\u00e0pies freely adopted bits of detritus, earth, and stone\u2014mediums that evoke solidity and mass\u2014in his large-scale works.\nIn 1950, his first solo show was held at the Galeries Laietanes, Barcelona, and he was included in the Pittsburgh International (now Carnegie International). The same year, the French government awarded T\u00e0pies a scholarship that enabled him to spend a year in Paris. His first solo show in New York was presented in 1953 at the gallery of Martha Jackson, who arranged for his work to be shown the following year in various galleries around the United States. During the 1950s and 1960s, T\u00e0pies exhibited in major museums and galleries throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and South America. In 1966, he began a collection of writings, La practica de l\u2019art (The practice of art). In 1969, the book Fr\u00e8goli, a collaboration with poet Joan Brossa, was published; a second joint effort, Nocturn matinal (Morning night), appeared the following year. T\u00e0pies received the Rubens Prize of Siegen, West Germany, in 1972.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Barcelona", "artistBirthDate": "1923", "artistDeathDate": "2012"}}, "532": {"paintingDate": "1945", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2007.47_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He graduated from the Fine Art School Hanoi in 1982, and the University of Fine Art Hanoi in 1989. He served as a lecturer at the latter from 1989 to 1997 before becoming a full-time artist. Following the advent of the Doi Moi (renovation) policy in 1986, which liberalized Vietnam\u2019s market policies, there was a resurgent artistic romanticization of Vietnam\u2019s past. Truong, for his part, abandoned the country\u2019s then-current academicism in favor of a practice focused on the complexities of human psychology and social circumstance. Through painting, drawing, performance, installation, sculpture, and ceramics, Truong challenges social convention and investigates themes of identity and freedom of expression.  \nTruong addresses the long-established prejudices that influence Vietnam\u2019s highly traditional society, examining national identity and its intersection with gender stereotypes. Centered on his own identity, the artist\u2019s work explores perceptions of homosexuality in a conservative milieu. This autobiographical emphasis is clear in Being Human (1996), a series of erotic ink drawings of the male figure. The series\u2019 visually reductive interpretation of the male form accentuates the phallus and presents relationships considered unconventional in Vietnam\u2019s contradictory environment of economic liberalization and social rigidity. Furthering this exploration are works such as Red Dreaming (2008) and How to be an Angel (2008). Painted in the traditional Vietnamese medium of lacquer, these works consider an individual\u2019s understanding of his or her own social status. The latter example in particular acts as a reminder of humanity\u2019s aspiration to an ideal of beauty and virtue, represented through the actions of figures rendered in Truong\u2019s signature style of flattened form and simple contour. The Wedding Dress (2001) turns away from themes of masculinity toward the image of Vietnamese women. In this sculpture, a skirt made from iron chains is combined with a bodice made of feathers. The heft of the chains represents societal oppression of women, while the fragile feathers symbolize the vulnerability and purity of the soul. Through the modification of domestic objects and social symbols, Truong creates new metaphors for the politics of contemporary Vietnam and the struggle between private and public identities.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Hanoi", "artistBirthDate": "1963", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "538": {"paintingDate": "1942", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/84.3167_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Although he is considered the father of Latin American Constructivism, he spent over 40 years of his life in the United States and Europe. Due to financial difficulties, his father moved the family to his homeland of Catalonia, Spain, in June 1891. It was there, in the town of Matar\u00f3, that Torres-Garc\u00eda studied drawing at the Escuela municipal de artes y oficios de Matar\u00f3 and painting under the artist Josep Vinardell. While he was a student there, he painted in oil, executing landscapes, interiors, and still lifes. In 1892 his family moved to Barcelona, where he attended the Academia de bellas artes before enrolling in the more prestigious Academia Baixas, and frequented the avant-garde artist caf\u00e9 Els Quatre Gats, which was the haunt of writers, intellectuals, and artists such as Pablo Picasso. During this time he made the acquaintance of the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, with whom he collaborated, from about 1903 to 1907, on the Templo expiatorio de la Sagrada Familia and the stained glass windows of the cathedral of Palma de Mallorca.\nIn 1918 he started to design wood toys as an extension of his teaching assignments; these toys integrated very simple forms into highly complex constructions, an early example of what he would do in his later Constructivist art production. He continued to design them after his move to New York in 1920, and they were manufactured for sale in 1922 after he returned to Europe that year. He settled in Paris in 1926, and after a rejection from the 1928 Salon d'automne, began to experiment with Constructivism, creating his first truly Constructivist works in 1929. His mature work from this latter period delicately balances natural and plastic elements, often containing signs that reference the indigenous cultures of South America. Late in 1929, Torres-Garc\u00eda met Piet Mondrian, and along with Michel Seuphor the three later founded the movement Cercle et Carr\u00e9 (Circle and Square). The group went public in 1930 with an eponymous journal and a group exhibition of 46 Constructivist artists at Galerie 23, Paris. The main goal of Cercle et Carr\u00e9 was to provide an artistic alternative to the dominant Parisian movement of Surrealism, and the association served as a forum for abstract artists to explore their ideas. Torres-Garc\u00eda ultimately left the group in 1930 after several disagreements with Seuphor.\nAfter a short period of time in Madrid, where he exhibited, taught, and gave lectures, Torres-Garc\u00eda returned to Uruguay in April 1934. There he founded the Asociaci\u00f3n de arte constructivo (Association of Constructivist Artists) and published the journal Circulo y cuadrado, which introduced the avant-garde art movements of Cubism, Neoplasticism, and Constructivism to artists in his home country. He published extensively on the theory of art, and partly due to his 1935 call for artists to invert the traditional hierarchy of art by placing Latin America before Europe in his text Escuela del sur (School of the South), has many Latin American followers.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Montevideo", "artistBirthDate": "1874", "artistDeathDate": "1949"}}, "115": {"paintingDate": "1950", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2012.49_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

Most well known for his contribution to the avant-garde movements of Fauvism and Cubism, Derain\u2019s oeuvre draws upon a diverse range of sources including the work of Paul C\u00e9zanne, non-Western sculpture, decorative and applied arts, Romanesque and Renaissance imagery, and French landscape painting.\nDerain\u2019s formal training began with Eug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re at the Acad\u00e9mie Camillo (1898\u201399) where he met Henri Matisse, at whose encouragement the younger artist exhibited eight works at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1905. Matisse and Derain spent the summer of 1905 in the French village Collioure, where Derain painted Fishing Boats, Collioure (Bateaux dans le port, Collioure, 1905) and other works in bold contrasting colors illuminated by bright southern light. That same year, Derain\u2019s work was shown at the Salon d\u2019Automne, Paris, where the critic Louis Vauxcelles used the word fauves (wild beasts) to describe a group of artists including Derain, Matisse, and Maurice de Vlaminck, whose style thus became known as Fauvism. During trips to London in 1905 and 1906, Derain produced city scenes composed of radiant color and unbroken light, such as Big Ben, London (Big Ben, Londres, 1906). In figurative works such as Bathers (Baigneuses, 1907), Derain fuses the volumes of C\u00e9zanne with the flatness and rhythmic design of non-Western sculpture, whose influence is also apparent in sculptures such as the archaic Crouching Man (Homme accroupi, 1907) and the gracefully totemic Standing Nude (Femme debout, 1907). In 1908 Derain traveled to the south of France with Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, and Othon Friesz. From 1908 through 1913, Derain\u2019s continued interest in C\u00e9zanne resulted in a series of landscapes such as Landscape at Cadaqu\u00e8s (Cadaqu\u00e8s, 1910).\nIn 1910, however, Derain destroyed much of his unsold work. Yet soon after this artistic crisis, Derain returned to his study of landscape painting, while also making vanitas still lifes in a proto-Cubist style. Late Gothic and early Renaissance themes feature in paintings such the pseudo-religious Saturday (Le Samedi, 1913), while works such as Italian Woman (L\u2019Italienne, 1913) demonstrate an increasingly stark and geometric classicism. After World War I, Derain found increasing commercial success, and in the 1920s he worked on a series of nudes and other figurative works such as Harlequin and Pierrot (Arlequin et Pierrot, ca. 1924). Classical mythology appears in his work from the 1930s on, as in Return of Ulysses (Le retour d\u2019Ulysse, 1938), which combines Last Supper imagery with that of a Homeric banquet. After the end of World War II, Derain made a number of landscapes of Normandy (in 1949), as well as illustrations and metal sculptures. Derain died on September 9, 1954, in Paris.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Chatou", "artistBirthDate": "1880", "artistDeathDate": "1954"}}, "113": {"paintingDate": "1995", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2003.110_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In 1916, he received a diploma in engineering and architecture from the Riga Technological University.\nLissitzky and Kazimir Malevich were invited by Marc Chagall to join the faculty of the Vitebsk Popular Art School in 1919; there Lissitzky taught architecture and graphics. That same year, he executed his first Proun (an acronym in Russian for \u201cproject for the affirmation of the new\u201d) and formed part of the Unovis group. In 1920, he became a member of Inkhuk (Institute for Artistic Culture) in Moscow and designed his book Pro dva kvadrata. The following year, he taught at Vkhutemas with Vladimir Tatlin and joined the Constructivist group.

That same year he began to paint, employing a purely nonobjective vocabulary that he continued to use throughout his career. While in Hanover, Vordemberge-Gildewart met El Lissitzky (who eventually encouraged him to experiment with the concepts of Russian Suprematism), Kurt Schwitters, Jean Arp, and Theo van Doesburg, who invited him to join De Stijl in 1924. In 1925 he participated in the Paris exhibition L\u2019art d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui, which featured a strong De Stijl presentation, and in 1927, Vordemberge-Gildewart, Schwitters, Hans Nitzschke, and Carl Buchheister formed the avant-garde group Die Abstrakten Hannover, championing abstraction in their region. \nVordemberge-Gildewart\u2019s first solo exhibition was held in 1929 at the Galerie Povolozky in Paris. The following year, he associated with members of Cercle et Carr\u00e9 (Circle and Square), an abstract artist\u2019s group organized by Michel Seuphor. In 1932 Vordemberge-Gildewart joined the Abstraction-Cr\u00e9ation group, founded to promote abstraction during a resurgence of representational art in the 1920s. He moved from Hanover to Berlin in 1936, seeking refuge from the cultural censure of the Nazi regime, which labeled modern art as \u201cdegenerate art\u201d (entartete Kunst). The Nazi Party of Munich displayed Vordemberge-Gildewart\u2019s work in its Exhibition of Degenerate Art in 1937, and later confiscated it based on the claim that it was un-German. Under such pressures, the artist left Germany for Switzerland, and shortly thereafter traveled to Amsterdam on the occasion of the 1938 exhibition Abstracte Kunst organized by the Stedelijk Museum. He remained in Amsterdam during its years of German occupation and eventually became a Dutch citizen. In addition to painting and sculpture, Vordemberge-Gildewart was active in typographical design and the literary arts, publishing a volume of poetry in 1940 and founding the Amsterdam-based publishing house Duwaer in 1942. \nCommitted to a nonobjective idiom, Vordemberge-Gildewart referred to his practice as \u201cabsolute art,\u201d or art devoid of representation. From 1934 through the 1940s, he used color, form, and contrast to investigate the possibility of visual equilibrium among geometrically unequal components. Works like Composition No. 96 (1935) demonstrate his dedication to geometric abstraction with an emphasis on diagonal form. Often creating multiple versions of the same work, the artist would reconfigure the primary elements to investigate each component\u2019s role in the composition. He also experimented with materials such as sand to create a textural quality that he designated rauh, or \u201crough.\u201d \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Osnabr\u00fcck", "artistBirthDate": "1899", "artistDeathDate": "1962"}}, "561": {"paintingDate": "1942", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/48.1164_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In the late 1960s he began directly copying simple head-and-shoulders photographic portraits onto canvas, using a limited palette of black and white, as in Big Self-Portrait (1967\u201368). In 1970 he returned to color, continuing to use photographic portraits as a model but incorporating a new technique in which he constructed the image from a gridded arrangement of individual color squares, each of which is like an abstract painting; viewed from afar, they form a unified, highly realistic image. Close would continue to employ a realist approach based on photographic reproductions in the decades that followed. In a series of works begun in 1971, he limited his palette to cyan, magenta, and yellow in imitation of color printing techniques used for the mass reproduction of images, as in Linda (1975\u201376). The rigorous systems Close employed as he explored different modes of representation link him not only to Photorealists such as Richard Estes and Audrey Flack, but also to Conceptual art.\nIn December 1988 Close suffered a seizure that left him paralyzed from the neck down. After \"The Event,\" as Close calls it, he underwent months of rehabilitation, eventually regaining some movement in his arms and legs. He continued to paint, using a brush strapped to his wrist with tape. Close also began to create wall-size portraits in tapestry, depicting both celebrity icons (such as Kate Moss) and friends (such as Cindy Sherman and Philip Glass), as well as himself.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Monroe", "artistBirthDate": "1940", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "89": {"paintingDate": "2004", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/2004.74_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In Ghost on the Happy Trail (2003), cartoon brains and schematic birds traipse across empty lots studded with jack-o'-lanterns and buried human heads. In The Artist's Garden (2006), the hyperreal detail present in other works gives way to an ultimately flat rendering of penciled forms against a gold backdrop. The work combines Byzantine stylistic elements with the ubiquitous flatness of mid-century modern painting in an indirect acknowledgment that the flatness associated with the death of painting is not a modern or new convention. More recent works, such as Experience (2009), depict scenes of lone artists endowed with beards generally associated with ancient philosophers, in slightly menacing, yet weary poses.

Although Bell became interested in art at a young age, he never received formal training. In 1957, he completed a BBA at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, and did not decide to pursue an artistic career until the early 1960s after touring in the U.S. Navy. At this point in time, he was working in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he was drawn to the vibrantly colored paintings of Richard Diebenkorn and Wayne Thiebaud. Other artistic influences Bell has cited range from Pop art to the realisms of Jan Vermeer and Salvador Dal\u00ed. It was through the painter Donald Timothy Flores, however, that Bell learned technique, most notably trompe l'oeil, while working in the former's San Francisco studio. Under Flores, Bell painted mostly small-scale landscapes and still lifes, which earned him the Society of Western Artists Award in 1968.\nIn 1967 Bell relocated to New York, where he set up his first studio. Two years later he began showing at New York's Meisel Gallery run by Louis K. Meisel, who popularized the term \"Photorealism\" and helped establish the style as a movement. Bell embraced a photo-based technique in his work not only for the way it renders imperceptible details visible, but also for how he saw the close-up photographic view as emblematic of contemporary visual experience steeped in a daily bombardment of media imagery. Bell carried out his Photorealist works by photographing his subjects in still-life compositions and painting from his image. \nAlthough Photorealism emerged as a national phenomenon, certain general qualities distinguish the coastal approaches to the movement. While the majority of the West Coast Photorealists preferred landscapes, particularly images of cars, trucks, and homes within an overall landscape, Bell, like many of the New York\u2013based Photorealists, focused on still life. Bell transformed everyday subject matter by enlarging ordinary objects like Raggedy Ann dolls and gumball machines to an unusually grand scale. His subjects are typically familiar objects associated with childhood, consumer culture, and play, and thus capable of resonating with a broad audience. By focusing on larger-than-life subjects, Bell's paintings also deny narrative readings of his work. He has described his approach to selecting subject matter as more of an emotional than intellectual process. The hyperrealistic precision of his technique, combined with an exaggerated scale, produces a sensation that oscillates between familiarity and unfamiliarity, thus engaging the viewer sensually and emotionally. The exploration of light remains a persistent theme throughout Bell's oeuvre, from his earliest treatments of light on mostly opaque surfaces to his interest in reflected and refracted light on transparent materials, as seen in the gumball machine series (1971\u201377). These investigations gave way to his subsequent interest in objects illuminated from within, such as pinball machines, which he began in 1977. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Tulsa", "artistBirthDate": "1935", "artistDeathDate": "1995"}}, "46": {"paintingDate": "1972", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/79.2664_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

In 1954 he received a BFA in graphic design from the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC, now California College of the Arts) in Oakland. After graduation, Bechtle began working as a graphic designer but was drafted into the U.S. Army the same year and stationed in Berlin. On his return to San Francisco in 1956, Bechtle\u2019s interests shifted from commercial arts to painting, which he began to study that year at CCAC. During this time he was introduced to the Bay Area Figurative movement, a group of artists who sought to counter the predominance of New York\u2013based Abstract Expressionism. While Bechtle was abroad, the renowned painter Richard Diebenkorn had joined the faculty at CCAC. He was an important influence on Bechtle, although the latter refused to take a class with the artist to avoid becoming overwhelmed by his influence. Bechtle began teaching at CCAC in the fall of 1957 and received an MFA in painting in 1958.\nBechtle is considered one of the founding Photorealists, a set of artists who used photographs as a point of departure for their hyperrealist art. He first introduced photographs into his painting technique in 1964 as a studio aid, while painting a scene with his wife Nancy Dalton, whom he often depicted in his work. By 1966 his use of photographs had evolved into an integral component of his process. Bechtle typically begins by selecting an image, usually his own photographs or anonymous snapshots, which he then projects onto the canvas from a slide. Bechtle held a particular fascination with the snapshot, typically amateur photographs of cars, for the nature of the subject matter, its immediacy, and lack of affect. He was attracted to the subversive implications of the photo-based technique for complicating the rigid genre hierarchies he had internalized in art school. Bechtle\u2019s interest in the everyday and the ordinary also reveals the influence of Pop art, which he saw firsthand while traveling in Britain in 1961. Bechtle\u2019s early Photorealist works are infused with a subtle realism, and an implicit sense of humor pervades his subjects and compositions. His best-known paintings focus on familiar suburban American middle-class subjects and themes, such as the car and the house. Unlike the gestures and lyricism of Diebenkorn and other artists associated with Bay Area Figuration, Bechtle was interested in attaining a more objective approach to realism.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "San Francisco", "artistBirthDate": "1932", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "47": {"paintingDate": "1931", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/70.1927_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

His siblings shared his interest in art; he devoted himself to painting while his older brothers Dino and Mirko became sculptors. Afro studied in Florence and Venice, and in 1932 his first solo exhibition was held at Galleria del Milione, Milan. In 1933 Afro started working in a figurative style rich in symbolic accents and pale and ethereal tones, akin to that of the Scuola Romana (Roman School), with which he was temporarily affiliated. Afro moved to Rome in 1938, but served in the Italian army (and participated in the anti-Fascist Resistance) during World War II. He also taught mosaic design at the Accademia di belle arti, Venice, and his work took a new slant, as figuration gradually gave way to a growing interest in Cubism. \nReturning to Rome in 1945, Afro encountered tensions between proponents of abstraction and those who favored realism, but he was only marginally involved in these controversies. By the end of the decade he had developed a strand of abstraction based on intersecting geometric planes and expressive juxtapositions of color and light. Increasingly weary of the polemics among painters in Italy, Afro turned his attention to the American scene. In 1950 he traveled to New York for the opening of a group show of Italian artists at the Catherine Viviano Gallery, a venue that hosted his first U.S. solo exhibition later that year and regular exhibitions of his work through 1968.\nFrom 1952 Afro's painting took a new direction, adding fluid signs, rounded contours, and a brighter palette and replacing the angular forms and quasi-monochromatic pictorial language of earlier years. That same year he joined the Gruppo degli Otto Pittori Italiani (Group of eight Italian painters, 1952\u201354), whose \"abstract-concrete\" leanings represented an alternative to the Italian abstraction-realism polarization. The group exhibited together at the 1952 Venice Biennale, but by 1954 Afro had distanced himself from the Otto\u2014a move that coincided with the introduction of an increasingly dynamic gesture in his works. More dramatic and spontaneous, Afro's late 1950s works testify to his growing interest in Abstract Expressionism, amplified by his friendship with Willem de Kooning, who stayed in Afro's studio in Rome in 1959, and Afro's frequent visits to the United States. James Johnson Sweeney, art critic and former director of the Guggenheim Museum, authored an early monograph on Afro in 1961. Afro's paintings of the 1960s were increasingly gestural, a tendency that he reversed at the end of the decade when his works became more synthetic and geometric. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Udine", "artistBirthDate": "1912", "artistDeathDate": "1976"}}, "489": {"paintingDate": "1952\u201353", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/GBM1996.4_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

He earned a BA in Philosophy from St. Pius X Seminary, Roxas City; a BFA in Visual Communications from University of Santo Tomas, Manila; and an MA in Art Studies at University of the Philippines, Diliman. In 1986, he founded Black Artists in Asia, a Philippines-based group focused on socially and politically progressive practice. In 1990, he initiated the biennial VIVA EXCON (Visayas Islands Visual Arts Exhibition and Conference). Roldan was a finalist for the Philip Morris Philippines Art Award, Manila, in 1996, 1997, and 1999. In 1998, he was awarded Juror\u2019s Choice for the same award as well for the Art Association of the Philippines Annual Art Competition. Roldan is the current artistic director of Green Papaya Art Projects (est. 2000), an independent, artist-run initiative and alternative art space that supports collaboration and exchange between Asia-Pacific and Filipino artists. Citing the influence of Joseph Cornell and Santiago Bose, Roldan juxtaposes objects, images, and textual fragments as a means to reject the idea of historical certainty and propose new social, political, and cultural narratives in its place.  \nOften employing the material embodiments of various genres and themes in a single collage, Roldan harnesses poignant aspects of shared and personal biography. His assemblage In Search For Lost Time 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 (2010) has its origins in an article on Hitler\u2019s Berlin apartment. Based on a conviction that the interior and furnishings of the dictator\u2019s home offer no insight into the true nature of the man, the work questions the importance of material culture in the study of anthropology. Roldan\u2019s series of nine works titled The Beginning of History and Fatal Strategies (2011) was inspired by Jean Baudrillard\u2019s essay \u201cThe End of History and Meaning,\u201d which details the idea of historicity, arguing that globalization precipitated the dissolution of history and the collapse of progress. Each work is a collection of curios, old perfumes bottles, compact cases, amulets, and old photographs displayed in wood and glass cabinets, recalling a past that is fabricated by an attempt to create a sense of order from forgotten memories. Focusing on Baudrillard\u2019s criticism of Marxist ideology as misguided fantasy, Roldan\u2019s series itself presents no political judgment or conclusion, but seeks instead to simply pit history against reality. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Roxas City", "artistBirthDate": "1953", "artistDeathDate": ""}}, "480": {"paintingDate": "1989", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/91.3905_cu_web.JPG", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

The son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, he was known as Yitzroch Loiza (Irving) Grossberg until age 17, when a nightclub emcee announced his band as \u201cLarry Rivers and the Mud Cats.\u201d He adopted the name that same year. Following a brief stint in the U.S. Army, Rivers spent a year at the Juilliard School of Music studying musical theory and composition. He then pursued his only formal artistic training at Hans Hofmann\u2019s painting school in New York from 1947 to 1948. Countering the vogue for abstraction at the time, Hofmann\u2019s approach emphasized drawing as the foundation of all art making and presented the old masters as rich resources for creative exchange. In 1951, Rivers received a BA in art education from New York University. \nProceeding from the conviction that figuration was not antithetical to modernism, Rivers completed his first major work, The Burial, in 1951, signaling the major concerns that he would return to throughout his life. With this painterly restaging of Gustave Courbet\u2019s masterpiece A Burial at Ornans (Un enterrement \u00e0 Ornans, 1849\u201350), Rivers began a sustained engagement with canonical paintings, imaginatively connecting contemporary art with art history. In works such as Washington Crossing the Delaware (1953), Rivers similarly mined the past for inspiration; a few years later, he began to take up more contemporary images, as in Dutch Masters and Cigars (1964), which was partly copied from a cigar box that itself depicted Rembrandt\u2019s 1662 painting The Syndics of the Clothmakers\u2019 Guild (De Staalmeesters). Subsequently, Rivers made several works that combine sculpture and painting, including I Like Olympia in Blackface (1970), which reverses the roles of \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Olympia and her African servant. Later that decade, Rivers began appropriating his own work from the 1950s and 1960s with the series Golden Oldies (1978\u201379). In an interview with his close friend the poet Frank O\u2019Hara, Rivers illuminated the premises of his approach, saying, \u201cI think of a picture of a smorgasbord of the recognizable.\u201d\u00b9 Two of his largest projects adopted broad historical themes. The History of the Russian Revolution from Marx to Mayakovsky (1965), an enormous mixed-media assemblage, incorporated painted portraits, architectural cutouts, stenciled lettering, and found objects. The monumental History of Matzah: The Story of the Jews (1984\u201385) also used text and three-dimensional relief elements, this time to narrate Jewish history from Moses to Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism.\nRivers\u2019s first major survey was organized by the Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1965; it traveled to the Pasadena Art Museum; Jewish Museum, New York; Detroit Institute of Arts; and Minneapolis Institute of Arts. A retrospective of his paintings and drawings opened at the Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio, in 1990, and toured the United States for a further two years, with stops in the Norton Gallery of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida; Fort Wayne Museum of Art, Indiana; Scottsdale Center for the Arts, Arizona; and J. B. Speed Art Museum, Louisville, Kentucky. In 1997, the Philharmonic Center for the Arts, Naples, Florida, staged a retrospective of the works Rivers made between 1980 and 1997. His most comprehensive retrospective to date was at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in 2002.

He worked as a commercial artist for several years and copied at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre before entering the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in 1862 to study for one year with Emile Signol and Charles Gleyre. At Gleyre\u2019s private studio, he met Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille, Claude Monet, and Alfred Sisley, who joined him in plein-air painting. In 1864 Renoir\u2019s first submission to the official Salon was accepted, and he began executing portrait commissions. The following year he visited the village of Marlotte near the forest of Fontainebleu for the first of many summers; he also met Gustave Courbet. His work was accepted intermittently at the Salon until the early 1870s. In 1869 Renoir met Paul Alexis, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Edmond Duranty, the photographer Nadar (F\u00e9lix Tournachon), and Emile Zola, and often painted with Monet. In 1871, after army service during the Franco-Prussian War, he returned to Paris. In 1872 Renoir met the dealer Paul Durand-Ruel and visited Gustave Caillebotte with Monet. He participated in the Salon des Refus\u00e9s in 1873 and in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874. He took part in the second, third, and seventh Impressionist shows of 1876, 1877, and 1882, but declined to show in the other four. Financial difficulties forced Renoir and other Impressionists to organize an auction of their work at the H\u00f4tel Drouot in 1875.\n", "artistBirthPlace": "Limoges", "artistBirthDate": "1841", "artistDeathDate": "1919"}}, "476": {"paintingDate": "1988", "paintingMaterial": "", "url": "http://annex.guggenheim.org/collections/media/thumbnails/88.3620_ph_web.jpg", "paintingLocation": "Solomon R.

The son of Ukrainian Jewish immigrants, he was known as Yitzroch Loiza (Irving) Grossberg until age 17, when a nightclub emcee announced his band as \u201cLarry Rivers and the Mud Cats.\u201d He adopted the name that same year. Following a brief stint in the U.S. Army, Rivers spent a year at the Juilliard School of Music studying musical theory and composition. He then pursued his only formal artistic training at Hans Hofmann\u2019s painting school in New York from 1947 to 1948. Countering the vogue for abstraction at the time, Hofmann\u2019s approach emphasized drawing as the foundation of all art making and presented the old masters as rich resources for creative exchange. In 1951, Rivers received a BA in art education from New York University. \nProceeding from the conviction that figuration was not antithetical to modernism, Rivers completed his first major work, The Burial, in 1951, signaling the major concerns that he would return to throughout his life. With this painterly restaging of Gustave Courbet\u2019s masterpiece A Burial at Ornans (Un enterrement \u00e0 Ornans, 1849\u201350), Rivers began a sustained engagement with canonical paintings, imaginatively connecting contemporary art with art history. In works such as Washington Crossing the Delaware (1953), Rivers similarly mined the past for inspiration; a few years later, he began to take up more contemporary images, as in Dutch Masters and Cigars (1964), which was partly copied from a cigar box that itself depicted Rembrandt\u2019s 1662 painting The Syndics of the Clothmakers\u2019 Guild (De Staalmeesters). Subsequently, Rivers made several works that combine sculpture and painting, including I Like Olympia in Blackface (1970), which reverses the roles of \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Olympia and her African servant. Later that decade, Rivers began appropriating his own work from the 1950s and 1960s with the series Golden Oldies (1978\u201379). In an interview with his close friend the poet Frank O\u2019Hara, Rivers illuminated the premises of his approach, saying, \u201cI think of a picture of a smorgasbord of the recognizable.\u201d\u00b9 Two of his largest projects adopted broad historical themes. The History of the Russian Revolution from Marx to Mayakovsky (1965), an enormous mixed-media assemblage, incorporated painted portraits, architectural cutouts, stenciled lettering, and found objects. The monumental History of Matzah: The Story of the Jews (1984\u201385) also used text and three-dimensional relief elements, this time to narrate Jewish history from Moses to Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism.\nRivers\u2019s first major survey was organized by the Rose Art Museum, Brandeis University, Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1965; it traveled to the Pasadena Art Museum; Jewish Museum, New York; Detroit Institute of Arts; and Minneapolis Institute of Arts. A retrospective of his paintings and drawings opened at the Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, Ohio, in 1990, and toured the United States for a further two years, with stops in the Norton Gallery of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida; Fort Wayne Museum of Art, Indiana; Scottsdale Center for the Arts, Arizona; and J. B. Speed Art Museum, Louisville, Kentucky. In 1997, the Philharmonic Center for the Arts, Naples, Florida, staged a retrospective of the works Rivers made between 1980 and 1997. His most comprehensive retrospective to date was at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in 2002. Rivers continued painting up until three months before his death in Southampton, New York, on August 14, 2002. \n", "artistBirthPlace": "Bronx", "artistBirthDate": "1923", "artistDeathDate": "2002"}}}
